# NLP project 2
## Santiago MARTIN & LÃ©o RINGEISSEN

This GitHub is separated in 2 subjects of the project : rating prediction and product classification.
We decided to separate this project into 3 differents notebooks :
- rating_prediction which contains everything regarding the rating prediction
- product_prediction which contains everything regarding the product prediction
- Streamlit_app which contains the cell generating the app.py, and runs it next.

All the models, vectorizers and encoder necessary for the streamlit apps are contained in the models folders, . We did not implement the best models like BERT in the app since they could not be pushed on git. 
We settled for the most effective models that could be pushed on git and therefore used by anyone cloning this repo.
