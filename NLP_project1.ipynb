      "My experience at this days inn was perfect. the staff were great and the manager (ted angel) was very helpful. The complimentary breakfast was always hot and they also provided bbq grills. I will really recommend this place to others that are planning on staying in san antonio The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and went out of their way to ensure our trip was enjoyable ! We were attending my nephew's Air Force graduation and the staff gave us very useful information to make the navigation of the base easier. A special thanks to Mr. Angel who worked the front desk the morning of our departure ! The location is great because its close to the base however the hotel is disgusting! It's dirty and there are roaches!!! I'm not sure how they are still open. I will never ever stay at that location or any of their locations because I don't risk having to deal with that environment. I wish people would have mentioned that in their reviews so I could have selected a different hotel. On a happier note, we are very proud of our graduate! Congrats to all of you who share the same feeling of pride. The service was great! Very helpful front desk no matter what time of day it was. The rooms are ok, bathrooms need some updating. Beds were too high for short people, but comfortable. Would stay again. Reserved a King room, None available at check-in / Left-over pizza was thrown away for no reason. I know my son would have enjoyed it. Location, location, location....(IF you can get over some of the other issues)... Perfect location for Lackland Air Base, and the staff was outstanding! Very helpful, polite, and friendly staff. The room however was damp feeling, dark & dingy. Carpet and tub in our room needed to be replaced. It's an old building so it needs some work. Also didn't feel so safe sometimes.... although we had no problems. Very quiet room very clean , 10 min. to downtown.\n",
      "asked for down stairs with close up parking no problem, the tv line up could use a update I cannot compliment enough the employee at the Front Desk \" Ted Angel\" He honestly went above and beyond when it came to giving exact directions around the city. We got lost from Airport for almost 2 hrs and could not find the Hotel. I was near tears at this point - Ted stayed on the phone with us and directed us right into the parking lot. (we were 5 min away at this point). He was very helpful and friendly with all our trips. Do not let this employee get away... Hard to find hotel for cab drivers and how to get in to parking lot. Room was not ready on check in. I booked online and was not disappointed. The hotel is not too far either from the Airport or the Conference Centre. The staff I met on ground were thorough and courteous. I wouldn't mind staying there again. It is a walking distance to the Conference Centre. To the General Manager ASH of Days Inn,\n",
      "My name is Jon and me and my family stayed at your Days Inn this past weekend and wanted to compliment you on your employee Jacob who was there Thursday night when we checked in… he was more than helpful and accommodating; he exemplified Customer Service more than I’ve seen in quite a while. All I can say is he is a great employee, and worth more than just this favorable review can express.\n",
      "The room we had 206, was very nice, clean and the bed comfortable… except for a bit of fresh paint It was 9/10. On top of a great room and host we enjoyed the complimentary hot breakfast served. BTW, we were never asked to pay a parking fee.\n",
      "I wanted to say thank you for an excellent experience and we’ll be sure to pass the recommendations on to our friends.\n",
      "Regards,\n",
      "Jon This place is good as far as cost. But I did NOT realize that it's $10 a day to park. Yes in the parking lot. Now if it was a parking garage maybe.....but this is an old motel 6 like parking situation.\n",
      "I guess there is a lot going on in San Antonio but come on ....Just put it in the price of the room not after. We had a good time.Nice staff, hot breakfast, comfortable beds, wifi and cooling and heat good. Hot showers. I know it is an older hotel but it served our purposes. Very close to Lackland AFB and not too hard to find. Several other hotels nearby.Parking was easy too, didn't have to park far. We were in the inner section by the pool. Didn't use the pool but it was very nice too. I was really impressed by the hot breakfast. Didn't have to worry where to go eat. We were there for our graduate from BMT and it was so nice to be close by. Upon check-in the evening receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Although there were quite a few people checking in ahead of me the wait time was minimal and he was friendly and courteous to everyone. The rooms look they have attempted an upgrade to include an HDTV, refrigerator, hair dryer, ironing board and iron. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. My room faced the pool so it was a little noisy with all of the kids playing in it, but overall value was good. Family, husband and I booked through Priceline for 2 days, 2 rooms with double queens at good rates. The staff were very welcoming, friendly, helpful. We liked how the rooms were connected so us family can stick together. The rooms were neatly updated with HDTV and comfortable beds. Breakfast area was small and wasn't all that great but there was a Denny's just a walking distance away. We would return if we were on a budget again. Oh, plus we got little gift bags which we appreciate, made us feel more welcome and thanked for being a guest. Housekeeping like to barge in on you by just letting themselves in, otherwise totally banging the door down! \n",
      "The view from our window was a brick wall. \n",
      "The swimming pool looks like a cess pit. \n",
      "The rooms are ugly and not that clean. \n",
      "The location is not convenient in the slightest. I have stayed at this hotel 3 different times in the past 3 months, I've been very satisfied with the staff they are very friendly and helpfully. Clean rooms for the most part. I think they may be upgrading some of there rooms because the second room I stayed in was very nice, nicer bathrooms then the others but the others were still nice. Very convenient if your going to be visiting Lackland AFB which was why I was down there, the base is literally down ther street. Clean pool if you want to swim and good breakfast even though I only went to it twice. It's a perfect hotel for the price range it is and I feel very safe when I stay there which is important. No complaints about the HoJo's staff. Reception was pleasant. All my requests were accomidated. Breakfast was nice, but all carbs. I had one of the back rooms: It was pleasantly large with a room fridge and microwave. Know that this is an older facility that shows it's age with noticable repairs in lieu of upgrades. It was like staying at your great aunt's house whose failing vision doesn't see allow her to see the dust, grime, and how the sheets need more than a good bleaching. But she did make the bed nicely and work hard to welcome you. The air/ heat could have worked better. The interior pool looked wonderful and lush. Though the property is surrounded on 3 sides by a large wrought iron fencing, it backs up to a neighborhood that looked fine. I felt comfortable in the immediate area.\n"

      "This trip was only a 24 hour lay over but wanted to plan a surprise for my boyfriend and was connected to Stephen Dyrus the Front Desk Manager. He not only helped me with the surprise he made it very simple and was just so professional. The Hotel is beautiful and in a great location for the beach cities. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone flying into LAX book your room with the Sheraton Gateway \n",
      "Amazing time and would stay there again I stayed here for three days on a recent trip to Los Angeles for work. The hotel itself is nice but the room was not clean. When i checked in it seemed that the counters in the bathroom were not wiped down and there was a small knat in the sink. I killed the bug but the next morning there was another. \n",
      "I did not use the transportation to and from the airport so i dont know how well that worked. I have stayed at other hotels near LAX and they were cleaner and more comfortable. I would not stay here again. I stayed overnight in LA for an international flight. The hotel is very well-located within minutes from LAX and if it's a smart choice if you stay 1-2 nights. Room was very quiet and clean. Bathroom was very good providing shampoo and body wash.\n",
      "I ordered a Greek salad for my dinner which was very nice and fresh( I usually don't order in-room service, but this was one of the best in-room dinings I ever experienced)\n",
      "The concierge service was very helpful and found me a sightseeing tour immediately at the time I asked for it.\n",
      "The free shuttle service to and from airport goes every 10-15 minutes. I've stayed here numerous times and never had any issues. The food for breakfast and room service is good. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is in close proximity to a shuttle that takes you to Manhattan Beach and retail stores for a nominal fee. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. I recently held a conference at the Sheraton Gateway, and found the banquet staff to be exceptionally accommodating. They were always there when I needed them, able to provide whatever it was I was asking for--Estela Estrada even went above and beyond providing personal touches to make my day. It was a pleasure hosting an event there and I would do so again in the future. The only reason I didn't give the hotel and exceptional rating was the air wall between rooms didn't offer much buffer of the sound going on in the room next to us. But the staff even helped with that by turning down the A/V volume. I recently had to stay overnight because of connections, arriving late one day and leaving early the next. The shuttle truly runs every 15 minutes without having to call - I had to go back to the airport to pick up luggage that was delayed in addition to my arrival and departure. I had a wonderful king room high up, no airport noise to speak of, large and comfortable. The front desk folks were helpful and pleasant. It is close enough to walk to the airport if you want but I did not have the time or had too much to carry. After a nice bath I snuggled up in the bathrobe that was hanging by the bathroom. I looked into the exercise facility and it looked great! I wish I had the time to use it! I will definitely stay here next time I have to pass through LAX. The stay at the Sheraton Gateway near LAX was as comfortable as could. Our room was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant. The only reason I did not give the highest review was due to an issue with the bar kicking us to the lobby on the last night. Our group was large and we brought in some take out food which was the result of having too large a party for the restaurant we were at. I was a volunteer staff for Peak Potentials. We held a 4-day seminar at the Sheraton Gateway from the 5th to the 8th of December 2012. The room service was excellent. The daily lunches I ordered for the trainer and his guests were delivered to his room on time and as requested. The hotel staff responded to our miscellaneous requests in a timely manner. Our server Estela Estrada cheerfully served us lunches and dinners. She was very attentive to our requests and went out of her way to please us. I would love to come back to this hotel. We stayed here for just one night as we had early LAX flight. The hotel is one of the closer LAX hotels which makes it nice spot for late arrivals.. etc. The rooms are nice and seem to have been renovated recently. There is valet parking as well as self park with in and out for around $17 i believe. There is a nice hotel lounge perfect for a late night drink.\n",
      "By far the only complaint we had is we tried printing out our boarding passes and it seemed to take forever at the nearby computer cluster but when we tried to print it asked for our credit card as if it were going to charge us for printing and when we asked front desk he said that shouldnt happen but didnt really provide us with resolution so we decided to print at airport next morning etc. This hotel is a under the management the KOR Group. The renovation definitely had the Wearstler eye. \n",
      "We actually stayed here for my birthday party. We had a day at the race track and decided to just hang out at the hotel. The steak restaurant was top notch, the rooms were great, the staff was accommodating. \n",
      "It is not as \"corporate\" as the other hotels. I highly recommend it. Especially for people who have a long layover at LAX or an early flight. There's a bunch of hotels in the area you can choose from, including some upscale ones, but they all lack a guy like Joe.\n",
      "Front Desk \"Joe\" is great. He understands a travelers needs and is very accommodating.\n",
      "The hotel is clean with a great bar & restaurants.\n",
      "I travel a bunch and I have always found that in general hotels are the same, but its the people that make the difference during your stay. We stayed here for just one night after a long haul flight. The hotel is located very close to LAX so perfect for our late arrival. There was convenient hotel shuttle that picked us up at the airport pretty much as we arrived. I found the staff friendly and welcoming at the desk on arrival.\n",
      "The room at the hotel was spacious, clean, the bed very comfy and room quiet, the perfect antidote for a long flight. So this hotel is 5 mins away from LAX, has a a good restaurant, the price is reasonable ($180), includes wireless and to top all that it has a really cheap rental-car E-Z Rental right next door. For the one day sales meetings this is a very convenient and service oriented hotel. I recently stayed at the Gateway Sheraton for 3 days and had a 4:25 flight leaving out of LAX which was literally 2 minutes away. My original check out was at 12:00, the normal time. When I called the front desk to ask about possibly getting a bit of an extension, Diane Cheek was on the other end. The minute she said 'Hello Ms Brown'...I could feel her smile through the phone. After explaining my situation, she immediately wanted to know what time I would like to check out...I hesitated and said,'2'? to which she replied...'would 3 really be better? bc that's no problem'..I couldn't believe it...I was able to relax a couple more hours in the room which made a huge difference preparing for a cross country flight. Thanks Diane and thanks Sheraton for such great customer service training for all of your employees...there is an obvious culture of 'customer first' mentality and it makes such a HUGE difference. Keep Rockin! Convenient for the airport, 5 minutes away, with a shuttle every 10 minutes or so. Check in was smooth and efficient which was great given it was 11pm when we arrived. As we'd booked a club level room and the club room was unavailable, we received an email a few days previously, upgrading us to a corner suite with complimentary breakfast, valet parking for our friend, and check out at 5pm which was great as our flight left at 8.30pm.\n",
      "Breakfast was great and use of the outdoor pool area, which was clean and tidy, was a great opportunity to catch some last minute sun.\n",
      "The room was big and very spacious and was a perfect stop-gap to our journey back to the UK from Hawaii. This hotel is convenient, the staff is terrific, the beds are comfortable and it is quiet. I left a pair of prescription sun glasses in the room, and lost and found reacted quickly, and they are on their way to me now. They offered a wonderful deal, ad I would definitely stay there again. Good location. Bus to airport was very handy, the driver took me about 4 am and did not wait for others which was nice. Rooms were good, seemed to be remodeled. I booked this late in the day and hoped for a better rate. I called and got a price from a Sheraton agent and then when I called back to book, the price was higher - and she would not give me the price quoted earlier. I have managed two medium work conferences at this hotel, and the service has been superior both times! The crew here is very attentive and helped me with many details, including wonderful food service. A special thanks to Estele Estrada, Sean Drury, Agustin Ortega, and Victoria Rabb for pulling everything off without a hitch! I stayed in this hotel in November 2012.\n",
      "I found the room to be spacious, the bed and pillows very comfortable,the room quiet despite being close to the airport although I did ask for a quiet room so I do not know if there are any rooms that can hear the air or road traffic.\n",
      "The room was very clean, with free Starbucks coffee. There is no safe or refrigerator in the room.\n",
      "Check- in was fast, the free Airport shuttle runs very 15 to 20 minutes.\n",
      "There was a bar, a restaurant and another restaurant that serves breakfast. I only tried the bar in the lobby for a soup and sandwich and they were quite good. Although the sports channel on the TV's were making the usual noise you would expect in a bar.\n",
      "The free computers and printers in the lobby were very convenient as I had to print off my boarding pass.\n",
      "The hotel is very close to the airport, about a 5-10 minute shuttle ride.\n",
      "By the way, if you are driving to this hotel , try to use the 105 expressway to get to the hotel instead of driving a long way on W Century Blvd where the hotel is located as the neighbourhood gets more and more sketchy the farther you are from LAX. We tanked up at a gas station a couple of miles from LAX on W Century Blvd and we were harassed by some strange people.\n",
      "I would stay in this hotel again. Typical 4 star hotel. Service was slow at check in/check out ie we weren't starwood regulars so we had to wait for 10 minutes to check in. This wasn't great after flying half way around the world. \n",
      "The food and service at the bars/restaurants were great. \n",
      "I was propositioned by two quite nice prostitutes. My friend was propositioned by a drunken guest who should've been cut off by the barman before he made a fool of himself. I loved the bed / pillows - they were almost too comfortable. However I ahd a hard time finding the lights in the room. The strange thing was the choice for lights on either side of the bed - they has a sliding thing that you had to find and turn on in order for the lights to come on - and, of course, I had no idea what / where they were. There was a slight light from the entry but I had to go across the room and turn on the normal lamp so i could see the sliding button on the bedside lights. Not obvious.... But the bed was comfortable. Checked in today with Eddie Rayas at the Sheraton Gateway LA. He was exceptionally helpful and very quick. Multi-tasking request while doing my check in. A great first impression for the hotel. He also managed to be courteous while still being friendly and having a little joke. Just what you need after a long flight. We stopped over in LAX on the way to Canada and loved staying at the Sheraton Gateway. The most noticeable difference between Sheraton and other hotels is the bed. The bed is amazingly comfortable!! We had been staying in a lot of fancy Fairmont hotels during our trip and their beds are terrible compared to the Sheraton.\n",
      "The room and bathroom was also good - spacious, clean, modern, well equipped. The windows are surprisingly noise proof, we hardly noticed we were staying next to an airport.\n",
      "The customer service is fantastic, we needed a late check out and they were more than happy to accommodate. \n",
      "In terms of amenties, there's a pool, starbucks, free use of internet computers and printer in the lobby, and a free shuttle buses to take you between the hotel and the airport. The shuttle leaves every 15mins but doesn't seem to run as regularly as the shuttles to Marriot or Hilton.\n",
      "The Sheraton is on the Ocean Express route, bus stop just in front of the hotel. The trolley costs USD5 for a round trip and it takes you to manhattan beach, manhattan beach plaza, el segundo plaza (probably the best closet shopping centre). It's great for a day trip out to the beach and there are plenty of restaurants down on manhattan beach. The bus runs from 9am till around 9 or 10pm from memory. \n",
      "Overall this is a fantastic option if you are stopping over in LAX and want a great night sleep ! This hotel is right next to LAX and is actually a very nice Sheraton. Staff are very helpful and courteous and the outdoor pool (could be bigger in size!) and hot tub is a welcome touch fro weary travellers.\n",
      "Rooms were large and nice but as other people have commented the bathrooms could do with being updated. \n",
      "Restaurant and bar was excellent and the bar food was of excellent quality - much better than I had expected.\n",
      "An excellent hotel. Sheraton Gateway LAX is a nice hotel, with free direct transfer to airport 24 hours a day. I used this hotel during a medical convention in Los Angeles (because all hotels near the Convention Center were fully booked) and the final evaluation was ver positive.\n",
      "The rooms are big, the restaurants are reasonably, the staff is friendly and available for help with any question.\n",
      "Two points that could be improved: there is no safer in the room and the parking is expensive. Anyway the cost / benefit is clearly favorable to this hotel. When travelling abroad you have no time for additional problems. From the time i entered the hotel until today all was perfect. check in, room, breakfast and service. This is the kind of service I am looking for. Today, I had a small problem with my TV, I called the guest request and i talked to a wonderful lady called Mirly. She organized everything, called me back and was concerned of my well being in the hotel. I was totally surprise of the kind of service i am receiving. Thanks Mirly for your kindness and your concern. I ll definetely can recomment this hotel. Kr. Laurent The Sheraton Gateway, LA was my haven when my travel plans were hit by Hurricane Sandy and I became a long-term guest. My room was large, overlooking the runway, with some aircraft noise but certainly not enough to disturb the fabulous comfort of the Sweet Sleeper bed. The pool area is nice, and the gym is substantial, plenty of treadmills. But what sets this property apart from many airport hotels I have experienced is the helpfulness of the staff, notably Diane Cheek in Guest Services, who was just fantastic, always so happy to help out with whatever I needed during my stay. I would certainly recommend this property to anyone who finds themselves at LAX. I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel when I had a late flight arriving into Los Angeles and wanted to get some good rest. Since I had arrived late, the hotel was sold out and upgrade options weren't available, which was kind a bummer. My first visit there about three years prior, I had a suite.\n",
      "The room I had was on the 14th floor on the back side. Since the room didn't face the LAX runway, it was quiet, but it was louder than a room that I had which faced the runway, but that didn't matter. The room was big and comfortable, although the furnishings were disappointing. The TV wasn't an LCD flat screen, the bed wasn't so comfortable (couldn't have been a Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed, or if it was, it an old mattress) and the bathroom was bland and unrenovated.\n",
      "Still, lacking furniture and fixtures aside, it had plenty of positives. There were good dining options available in the morning for breakfast, an incredibly helpful and friendly staff, close proximity to virtually all destinations and rental car services in LA and a modern lobby. It was too early to make use of the pool, but the pool area was so nice. The staff accommodated my need to have a 4pm checkout.\n",
      "All in all, the hotel was above average for an airport hotel and I'll definitely stay here again, although I'll insist for a renovated room. This Hotel is very nice and centrally located, it has 15 floors. The rooms are in excellent condition and very well maintained. Close to freeways and walking distance to the airport. Nice restaurant with real good expensive food and nice centrally located Bar. The staff is wonderfull and will do anything to help you out. This hotel is great if money is no object, if you are on a budget there are a few draw backs.\n",
      "1) Hotel Rooms are very expensive per night during the week day\n",
      "2) Hotel self Parking is $15 and is a block away\n",
      "3) Valet parking is $30 per night. The airport shuttle is very efficient with short turnaround times. The bus is not shared by any other hotel so you go directly to your hotel.\n",
      "The corner suite was very spacious, thought there was no ref in the room. The solitary TV is not well-positioned - one cannot watch TV from bed, only from the living room. \n",
      "Although it was a suite, the bathroom did not have a separate tub and shower.\n",
      "Check-in was very efficient and courteous. The concierge desk was very helpful with all my requests.\n",
      "It was convenient to have a Starbucks right at the lobby.\n",
      "It was a Saturday night so room service took very long. And I had to call twice to follow-up on my second order. My husband and I popped in here the night before an early flight. It was not my first stay here, but it was his.\n",
      "The first time I stayed here was in January 2011. It was a very slow travel week, but they upgraded me to a gigantic room and I was really pleased, as I was there to work with a group and it was great to basically have conference space inside my room. This more recent stay in October 2012, the room we were upgraded to was quite a bit smaller and oddly laid out, but it was fine.\n",
      "The hotel itself is generally pretty nice for a Sheraton, especially the lobby feels every bit as nice as a Westin. \n",
      "Unfortunately, my husband was really upset with our treatment by the concierge when we arrived. It really was an odd, almost unbelievable encounter. It was quite late, so rather than try to get food at the hotel, we were hoping to have some pizza or Chinese food delivered. When my husband asked at the concierge desk, the man at the desk didn't look up from what he was doing, started digging in his papers, found a small slip and handed it to us. It had the numbers of a few taxi companies on it.\n",
      "Confused and thinking perhaps he didn't understand us, I said \"Not taxi. Food delivery,\" though truthfully I thought someone who didn't understand English would be an odd choice for a concierge. At this point, a bellman who was standing behind the concierge watching the exchange started laughing quietly.\n",
      "\"One second,\" the \"concierge\" said. (Oh, so he DOES speak English...) He then dug out a different colored slip of paper which had the numbers of a few pizza places on it. Again, he never really looked up from his desk or acknowledged our presence. It was very, very strange.\n",
      "My husband is a business traveler who knows exactly what sort of treatment to expect from 3-star hotels. He also isn't fazed by much. But he was quite upset after this, which to me means it was really egregious.\n",
      "After this time, it will take a really amazing rate to get me to stay here again. This hotel is situated very close to LAX and has its own shuttle bus running 24/7.Very good, well laid out rooms, excellent sound and light proofing.Very quick checkin with pleasant staff. Superb pool and fitness centre. Right beside a long term car park so ideal for the late arrival or the early departure. They even have a bus to connect to local Malls. This hotel is an ideal Airport Hotel and ticks all the boxes for weary travelers wanting a good nights sleep. Good value for a comfortable stop over. Shuttle service was excellent - didn't have to wait very long for any of the four times we used this shuttle. Dinners in the bar area were reasonably priced and the service was good. A la carte for breakfast was good, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The rooms are very comfortable. However, on the two occasions we stayed here, both of the rooms we were in had a shower with a mind of its own. The first shower head sprayed water all over the bathroom. In the second, we couldn't decrease the almost painfully high water pressure in the shower head, and the plughole didn't drain the water out quickly enough, so by the end of the shower you were standing in a couple of inches of water. Thank you Diane Cheeks!!! I needed a refrigerator for my medication and she had it up to my room in less than 10 minutes! She even called back to make sure that it was sent up in a reasonable time. I wish more companies would hire people of excellence like Diane! Stayed at the Sheraton overnight before a flight. The hotel itself is very modern and upgraded. I had a good view of LAX. The room was well appointed and the bedding was excellent. One drawback is the cost of parking $30 and its only valet. All in all the service was good as well.\n",
      "Probably the best LAX hotel I stayed at. In retrospect, I am disappointed with the Sheraton experience. I stayed for 5 nights at Sheraton Gateway LA. I will start off with my first impression, as you walk in, it might be broad daylight outside but they keep the lights so dark and dim it made me feel like I needed to whisper in case people were sleeping. The room was spacious, we had 2 queen size beds, a bathroom, tv with cable. The wifi is not free in the hotel room its like $12 per hour to connect to it unless you are in the lobby. they do offer internet access in their business centre though. There is a free shuttle from LAX airport to the hotel, if you arrive via Amtrak train or greyhound bus station check out flyaway or flyoway shuttles, its about $7 to the airport then take the free hotel shuttle from the airport to the hotel. All their staff were helpful and friendly and relatively knowledgeable. Breakfast is expensive, $21 for buffet breakfast but they do offer a la carte menu too around $9-$18. There is valet parking, but be careful if you get lost of need to ask a question about self parking, the valet came up to me and his attitude was to get out and give him my car or get out of the way because \"you are blocking the shuttle\" i was very upset by this on my first day, i had to somehow find my way around the area to get back to the hotel but when I mentioned it at the checkin counter the girl was understanding and she did ensure i was not charged for parking my car as their way of apologising for his behaviour. Valet parking is about $30 a night, call me stingy but i think thats a bit much. your alternative is to park at the self parking garages near by they charge about $12 a day, however, do be careful and some will not let you go in and out without having to repay at each exit and entry. The location to the airport is very good, however, if you want to explore the Los Angeles you either need a car or need to be prepared to walk and use public transport - which isnt all that fantastic but it IS cheap ($1) per ride. Bus station is about a 5min walk from the hotel. They do also offer tours to hollywood, disneyland etc, which I took advantage of, a tour company will arrive to pick you up from the hotel, they take you to their location where you pay for your tour, then drop you off at your hotel at the end of it. I think I had some sort of allergic reaction to something in the room because I was very itchy for a few days afterwards, maybe it was the type of cleaning products they used on the sheets im not sure though. The bed was not all that comfortable, perhaps it was just that bed, the feather pillows werent all that comfy either, however, I was told afterwards that you can request in advance to have the pillows changed to foam onces. Checkin staff were great helpful and good attitudes, valets are valets what can you say, concierge staff were pretty good, cleaning staff did a good job. they do have a small laundry facilities ($2.00 in quarters only) per load and per dry. they only have 1 washer and 1 dryer. No fridge in the room. There is one outdoor pool with an in ground hot tub outside and it was nice hanging out there. As for value for money, I would not stay there again myself but it wasnt bad. It just wasnt a great experience for me. Nice proximity to LAX with usually regular shuttle service, though slow at times (waited about 30 minutes at midnight on a Sunday - versus waiting about 3 minutes for a ride back to LAX on Monday am). Lobby, staff and such are pretty good. Rooms are ok, but bathrooms (showers in particular and tiling) are VERY dated.\n",
      "My biggest complaint is the cost of breakfast: $5 for OJ, $4 for coffee, $12 for Pancakes (no sides), $21 for the buffet (fairly nice and reasonably extensive). I wanted to appreciate the guest services staff at the Sheraton Gateway. I was inquireing about the cost and how to use the wifi connection at the hotel. Dianne explained that I could use the wifi for free any time from their extensive and comfortable lobby. She also explained the cost and procedure for using it in my room. It was quick and easy to get an account and begin to use the internet. Afterward Dianne offered to comp me the first day of use for that service. Truly, that help met my entire need, I had a need to use the internet extensively the first day I arrive. The conference I attended occupied my time more and more as the week went on. So quick use of the free wifi from the lobby just to monitor email was adequate the rest of my stay. Let's see: easy to access (there's even a light on Century), fast valet parking service, nice rooms, good options in terms of on-site food and drink... and somehow quiet as could be despite being adjacent to the landing approach for LA-bound jets. That's a tough package to beat.\n",
      "Service was friendly and good throughout my stay. Stayed here with a 50-person student group for two nights due to the reasonable reviews and ease of getting in and out of the airport. I would usually not consider this type of hotel for a 'personal' stay due to all the issues related to a big, impersonal, industrial type of convention/airport hotel. Well, this is a big hotel, but it is anything but impersonal. The concierge desk is very professional and helpful for starters. The breakfast buffet is really good, and the service is excellent - always smiling and doing a great job. The only downside that I saw, but didn't experience, is that the front desk is a bit understaffed, particularly at night, and not all that friendly. The lines to check in were ridiculous late at night when many of the international flights arrive. Can't imagine getting off a flight from Australia and then being stuck in a line to check in for 45 minutes.\n",
      "The staff that handled our group was really difficult when we were booking the property months ago, but once we got connected we received great service, right up to group check in, which was super easy. They even put the University of Utah logo on all of the breakfast coupons. Sounds dumb, but it was pretty cool. We had a last minute request for a pizza dinner and Billy Cubillas (and Alfonso Martinez) put a wonderful spread on in less than an hour. Happy to do it too!\n",
      "Oh ya, the rooms. Ours was pretty much all newly remodeled, very clean and great in every way. Lots of room! Even though the property is basically on the LAX tarmac, the architect designed the walls and windows to block out nearly 100% of plane noise. Absolutely not an issue. The lobby area and bar area seem to be newly remodeled and were very well maintained.\n",
      "Bottom line is, whoever the manager is here is doing an outstanding job. I would definitely stay again personally on a layover at LAX, or with a group. Nice job, Starwood! Stayed here 2 nights. We were given a lovely room but unfortunately it was above some air conditioning units which made quite a lot of noise. We asked to be moved and were given a 9th floor room with a balcony with views of the Hollywood Hills. This room was a bit smaller but very nice just the same. Helpful and friendly staff. It's a bit out of the way so we ate in but it was good and not too expensive. I booked this hotel because it was one of the least expensive chain hotels in LAX. I was surprised by the quality of the hotel. It was clean and larger than I had expected. I think that I may have stayed at the hotel years ago but I could not recognize it. The changes have made the hotel nicer. The only issue would be to change the bath in the bathroom. They are old and look worn. Other than that the rooms are nice and clean. Beds were first quality and bedding was clean. The lobby couches are strange a little Alice in wonderland style. I would recommend the hotel for business or flying through, hotel shuttle is great. Parking is difficult to understand parking in back of hotel, valet only with the hotel and different rates from quote over phone. Shuttle Service, 24 hours, 7 days, every 10 minutes pick up and drop off from LAX! 10 minutes drive away from LAX\n",
      "Starbucks in the Hotel. Subways around the corner.\n",
      "Go to the public phones and the PC nearby will print your boarding passes for free.\n",
      "Get the blood pumping after your long haul flight with a work out in the fully equiped gym or the outside pool.\n",
      "Just around the corner from the bar you have free internet access with 6 PC's available.\n",
      "Rooms a bit dated, pillows super soft.\n",
      "If your keen there is a shopping centre 20 minute power walk.\n",
      "Free safty deposit box at reception.\n",
      "The service, drinks and food is your usual Sheraton high standard. Stayed at this hotel to welcome a cousin coming in from a trip and staying only for one night before he left to go out of the country. The Sheraton LAX is huge, but it remains an efficient operation. The SPG line was quick, we got checked in right away and got a free upgrade to a corner suite! It had excellent views of the pool and the airport runways, but no noise could be heard because of the sound proof glass. The big bank of elevators allows quick boarding of guests, no long lines typical of a huge hotel. They use Starbucks coffee in the room, along with generous toiletries spa quality. The suite is huge, one can conduct small meetings, and it could work as well for families travelling together with the adjacent rooms, or weddings. Flat screen, wifi-everything was in good working order. The shuttles to LAX are frequent, the business center had free wifi, the pool next to the gym is great, although pool guests have to walk through the lobby to get to their rooms. The former restaurant Don Shula's was an excellent steak house, but it is now Paparazzi-didn't have time to try it but will next time. We had to go to Disneyland! Previously stayed at Westin LAX, but personally, for Starwood Preferred Guests, the Sheraton would be a better choice for those who want good service, efficient and centrally located! From the mattress to plumbing to a broken door latch, the room suffered from terrible physical neglect. But, the staff personnel from the cleaning crew to the front desk to waiters at the breakfast dinning: they proved to be much, much more professional and courteous than those I encounter at Westin or Hilton, both at LAX. The waiter who's worked a number of decades at this place, was very impressive in guest handling. Vessenia Pouce at the front desk was extremely helpful, who made my overall impression good enough for me to wish to return. I almost doubted my decision to stay 2 mins from LAX amidst the congestion on our last night instead of a more peaceful place. Wow—was I pleasantly surprised though.\n",
      "The décor was very nice and looked new. There was a starbucks in the lobby open from 5am to 4pm, a sports bar, and a very nice, fancy and delicious restaurant for dinner. The close proximity also allowed me to return our rental car a day early. There’s an airport shuttle every 15 minutes and it was so close, Hertz drove us back for free personally from our car return. You could even set up a massage if you like. We had a great room service breakfast and headed out early the next morning. I’d fully recommend for airport convenience without a doubt. Arrived at the hotel on 21st September after a late flight from London. Shuttle bus arrived after about five minutes and we were greeted by a very effusive driver who \"welcomed us to LA\". Five minutes later we arrived at the hotel and all the check in desks were quickly opened so check in was very swift. Got an upgrade to a corner room on my Starwood Gold card. Breakfast, [included in my rate] was excellent with a good choice of fruit, fried breakfast etc. Check out was also very efficient. \n",
      "Having stayed at LAX several times this is without doubt the best of the airport hotels. Combine a great rate for the room, including two breakfasts, $129, booked direct with Sheraton on the web and you cannot go wrong.\n",
      "Everything above expectation so definately will return on the next LA trip. The employees at this hotel seem to be a part of a team spirit to provide unusually good service at the Sheraton Gateway. As a veteran traveler, I'm accustomed to a routine script of hotel employees. At this hotel, however, the employees seemed to genuinely eager to share hospitality.\n",
      "Having earned a Starwood Preferred Guest suite upgrade, the room chosen for me was large but cave like with only one window. Promptly the front desk reassigned me to sunny room with a panoramic view. On the second day, the housekeeper, Lydia, noticed a minor flaw in the duvet and wanted to replace it with a better one, which I thought unnecessary. While the bathroom sink had hot water, I wondered if I were too picky that the shower seemed to produce only fairly warm water. After a call for servicing, promptly a thermostat was replaced and plenty of hot water ensued. Later my keycard was demagnetized, possibly by my cell phone, and as there was a bit of a line at the front desk, Manny at the concierge desk kindly and promptly took care of this matter - Thank you Manny. Telephone operators were unusually good, as well as front desk staff. \n",
      "Distractions: Sure the hotel has a bit dated structure, but rooms are well maintained and the decor is ok. The club lounge closes daily at 9am for breakfast, a bit early especially on weekends. There could be more of a welcoming guest ambiance up there. \n",
      "The generic bathroom toiletries do not state their country of origin - I'm wary about certain imported products. \n",
      "Overall: Instead of seeking just the lowest price in this category of hotel, consider the all around value and service of the Sheraton Gateway. Formerly I stayed at another slightly less expensive property close by, but the overall attentiveness to being hospitable makes this my recommended airport hotel. Stayed 2 nights here for a work conference. The conference room itself was fairly standard, however the staff made the experience well-beyond standard. The sales and event manager, AV director, catering director and server were extremely helpful, friendly and attentive to our every need. I would definitely use their services again for work events! The rooms are good. The restaurants convenient and reasonably priced. And it's within walking distance of the terminals: so if the shuttles (not run by the hotel itself) are too full to stop for you (as happened to me), you can walk. Stayed at Sheraton Gateway before an early morning flight. We were pleased to be able to check in at 11am. Room was clean and comfortable, bathroom dated and small but clean and served the purpose for one night. Enjoyed a swim in the outdoor pool which was a pleasant surprise at an airport hotel and had a meal at the restaurant which was also pretty good. Shuttle service dropped us at our terminal within 15minutes the next morning.\n",
      "Would reccommend Sheraton if you need an aiport hotel, it was a lot closer to the airport than some of the other 'airport' hotels. This was my second stay at this hotel. The staff could not have been better. Excellent in every way. The hotel is very close to the airport, so very conveninet. The shuttle runs frequently. \n",
      "I had a room overlooking the runways so for airplane enthusiasts it is a great location. The hotel looks like it was built around the 1960's. Some areas seem original. The rooms are very nice, but the bathrooms are very old and need renovation. Cosmetically the rooms and hotel have been updated, but the \"bones\" are still the original. The hallways and bathrooms are form the 1960's.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel. After first staying at the Sheraton LAX Gateway 9 months ago, I've made it my \"home away from home\" when I travel to Los Angeles every week. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy your stay and get a good nights sleep. We stayed here before our flight out the next morning. We arrived about 7pm for check-in. The computer crashed, so we had to wait for it to come up (about 15 minutes). Being a Lifetime Platinum member, I used the check-in line for the Starwood Gold & Platinum. I was 2nd in line, with one person doing the check-ins. There were 3 other counter attendants handling the non-Starwood people. They checked-in several people that arrived after I did before I even got to the counter. The Starwood line was pretty long at this time - they should allocate more people to handle the Starwood line.\n",
      "We did get a nice room overlooking LAX. Since I am a Platinum member, I normally get the water for free. I was somewhat surprised when I got home and was emailed an updated bill for an additional $6 for two bottles of water.\n",
      "Club Lounge was not that great - only a continental breakfast. Shuttle to the airport is very convenient and runs frequently enough to get you to the gate on time. The free airport shuttle ideal and the service is very frequent. Plus being to close to the airport makes this the ideal hotel for any traveller. The rooms and amenities are what you would expect from Sheraton (all first rate). It was the staff that made the whole experience so much more memorable. Cannot say enough good things about the staff. after years of avoiding it I finally joined the the Starwood Preferred Guest programme.\n",
      "Highly recommend this hotel My wife and I had a perfect 4 night stay, Hotel exceeded all expectations, we traveled around L.A., Hollywood, Rodeo, Santa Monica, Malibu & beyond including Camarillo and Santa Barbara. The service was helpful and accommodating. The Hotel is well appointed with a Lounge, Restaurants and a Pool, we took advantage of the Internet/Business Lounge to keep in contact with home. There is a Starbucks in the Lobby that we enjoyed every AM. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. To whom it may concern...I just want to take the time out to recognize the pleasent customer service I received throughout different departments of this hotel.First I had just been on a 25 day travel with business and some vacationing with my 3 yr old daughter on her 1st trip to the east coast....Know that was an adventure in its self....So after a late flight arrival.....I took the hotel shuttle to the hotel apon my arrival ...I had 4 big bags of luggage and a 3yr old sleep....Struggling is a modest word for how I was feeling....the shuttle driver assisted me with my bags{Didn't get his name}was excellent he connected me with conceige dept who then proceeded ask was I checking in...I truly was not going to checkin....I said yes based on the service I had received thus far....mind you my car waiting for me in longtime parking ....I look at the front desk to see if there was a line ...and there wasn't...They proceeded to assist me with my child and reservation and baggage....I want to acknowledge a couple of your team members who really went above and beyond the call of customer service....Front Desk..Claudia,Lissette,Robert,Eddie and last but not least Mustafa...Mind you I never made a reservation...They where as attentive to my every need...Bags ,Baby, Food ect...Also once in the room they called to check in on me to see if I was ok or needed anything...I want to say that you are blessed to have these individuals on your staff ....they are truly assets to your organization...Diane you receptionist was great...she assisted me with room service and a very good listening ear....The room and facilities was great ...I work directly in the Customer Service Field as an Operation Manager and travel 50% of my job so I have a keen eye for it....Just wanted to say Thank You Sheraton Gateway Staff Los Angeles...I will be back.\n",
      "D.Chase I felt welcomed and appreciated as a guest. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful with my check in. My room was lit when I entered so I didn't have to hunt in the dark for the light switch. The dinner in the lobby bar was excellent and the wait staff attentive and courteous. The free shuttle service to and from the airport is a nice convenience. The computers in the lobby made it easy for me to print out my boarding pass for the flight home. I will definitely stay at this hotel again on my next visit to LA. As far as the room goes, the bed and pillows are comfortable, but I was expecting better from A Sheraton. The bathroom smelled of mold or mildew. Also the TV sound and picture constantly cuts out on the Showtime channel. I called for this to be corrected, but after the technician changed out the coaxial cable and it didn't fix the problem he told me he would call Lodgenet to try to correct it. This was not fixed.\n",
      "I doubt I will ever stay here again. We recently spent a night at the Sheraton Gateway in Los Angeles to be close to the terminal\n",
      "for an early morning flight. The hotel staff was very gracious, the room spotless with a pleasing view. The lobby bar is well stocked and the bartenders very friendly and attentive. The shuttle next morning to the airport 5 mins away was waiting for us and made for a smooth departure.\n",
      "I would definitely stay here again. Surprisingly fine hotel. Great location near the airport, only 5 minute ride by hotel bus service. Public areas are spacious and attractive. Very nice outdoor patio complete with pool, hot tub and cabanas. Super friendly and helpful staff. Good food at standard hotels prices (a little expensive), but quite good. As good a hotel as many higher rated and more expensive ones. Everything was new and spotless. Excellent value. Oddly, the only exception was the concierge who could definitely improve his people skills. We found this hotel through Priceline and managed to score a great deal. The staff is wonderful. Everyone is very pleasant and welcoming. The room was large and clean. \n",
      "The location does not require you to eat at the hotel as there is a Subway and Burger King within walking distance. There is occasional noise from airplanes but we were not bothered by it nor did it disrupt our sleep. We received prompt pick up at LAX, spending the night prior to a cruise from Port of Los Angeles. We couldn't have asked for a more comfortabl overnight. A recent stay at the Sheraton Gateway provided evidence that people make the difference. The hotel itself is ideally located to the airport and is perfect if you need to be close to LAX. The accommodation themselves were just average but from the moment I walked in the lobby to the moment I hopped off the shuttle at 4:30AM to fly out, the staff was as friendly, helpful and conscientious as any I have dealt with in a long time. I was greeted and checked in with respect, a sense of humor and a good nature Front Desk staff consisting of Mustafa, Joseph, Eddie and Evelyn. The were friendly, fast and well-trained. Jose in the bar was terrific and though there were periods of chaos in the bar area due to the large crowds, he kept my glass full as requested without missing a step. Even the shuttle driver, a young lady whose name I did not catch seemed in a far better mood than I would be around LAX at 5:30 in the evening. If service is what counts, and it is to me, these folks will treat you right! I was in a conference with a large group last week and our group had to rely for meals and tending to whatever we needed to the Banquets dept. I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff, in particular a waitress, Estela Estrada. She went out of her way to make sure our group was comfortable and we would feel at home away from home. I often think that when traveling in conferences, it is difficult to adjust to all the schedules and meals and when food is prepared and served with great service, it makes the experience worth coming back to the same location. Thank-you Estela and all the Staff at the Sheraton Gateway! I've stayed here twice before when transiting through LAX with my wife and prefer it to the Westin. Arrived late, shuttle from terminal very convenient, check-in smart and efficient. Our room on 15th (Club) floor modern and bed very comfortable. Bed linen of high quality. In room coffee maker with Starbucks coffee and a complimentary bottle of water which was nice. Bathroom is a bit of a let down being very small and a little dated, though very clean and well appointed. Missed the complimentary evening food and breakfast in club lounge so cannot comment on that. We did share some nachos in the lobby bar upon arrival which serves food pretty late. Service good despite bar being very busy with convention folks and food good. Will stay again. Stayed here before and it was great too. Spent one night having arrived from Zurich and leaving the next morning for Phoenix. Excellent room quality, good food, efficient and helpful service, a shuttle service that works and good value for money too. Hope it stays this way. On arrival we dropped the bags and my wife in the valet and I self parked in the public carpark behind. I came back ten minutes later and found that none of the staff had come to assist my wife or offer her a trolley etc.\n",
      "Registration was difficult as staff would not allow my wife to register for us, as I had booked, even though we have the same surname and address....some common sense would be helpful.\n",
      "The rooms were pretty drab and probably in need of an upgrade, although very very clean. The bed and linen was quite comfortable. I don't normally use the services of a mini-bar, but I was hanging out for a beer and they don't have a fridge in the room.\n",
      "The breakfast buffet served in the restaurant downstairs is excellent and very good value at $20. The hotel is very close to the airport and to the car rental places. I've stayed at the Sheraton Gateway a couple of times now and have been quite happy both times. As with most people, I'm only there for a night, coming or going on a business trip. The rooms are spacious and modern. The views over the airport or LA are great on the higher floors. The fitness center is one of the largest standard fitness areas I've found. There are a long line of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, free weights, machines, Swiss balls, and mats -- everything you need for a workout. The room also looks over on the pool area. The pool area is quite large with lots of chaise lounges if you have time to relax outside. The staff is friendly and helpful too. Writing this review in this hotel! This is my first stay at this hotel and it would probably be my last. I arrived late last night and took the shuttle to the hotel. The driver was extremely friendly and helpful with my heavy bags. When I got to the hotel, there were bellmen to be seen so I had to manage my bags on my own. Not a very good first impression! I got my room keys and headed up to my room. The lobby was very spacious and in fact, the entire hotel looked exactly like the pictures you see on their website so that's always a good thing! The room was big but the furnishing were rather tired, the bathroom too was dated. The room is definitely lacking in lighting and the towels in the hotel have seen better days. I am pretty sure they were clean but they were not exactly white and fluffy, but torn and rough. Definitely not what I'd expect from a Sheraton! Next time when I am in the area, I'd definitely stick with my usual choice -- Hilton LAX! Good location, good bar, a little busy but not bad. Airport shuttles run pretty regularly. 2 min walk to Subway restaurant if you want something cheaper. Good hotel gym with view of the pool. Xbox with kinect games set up in lobby. Like most i spent the night here in transit through LAX and have to say this is my pick of all the Century Blvd hotels. Nice friendly check in and out service with good sized rooms and comfy beds. Even though i was facing the Airport and Blvd the airport noise was at a mimimum. The convience of the free LAX shuttle combined with free wifi in the lobby, a good bar, comfy lounge chairs and lots of big screens means you can hang out here until just before you need to make the break to LAX and save yourself the pain of spending too much time trapped in the dreary LAX terminals. I would recommend this hotel for that alone! I will be back for sure next time i am in LA and waiting to jump on a plane. Recently had a small family reunion and we all stayed at the Sheraton. We had no problems with checking in or our rooms. The staff was very accomodating. The rooms were silenced, so even though we were almost right next door to the Airport, we slept like babies, not a sound was heard. We ate at the bar one evening (wine selection a good one) and in the Italian restaurant another night. Although the Italian restaurant Paparazzi was a bit pricey, the food was out of this world. The Chef is awesome!!! We were treated like royalty by the staff in the restaurant (which we are NOT). We all would recommend the restaurant. I used the gym as well and the equipment was plentiful and well rounded. \n",
      "If you are driving, parking is very expensive at the Hotel, but you can park in the back for $15.00 a day with in and out privileges which is what we did. A bonus is that Starbucks is on site, so I went and got my hot chai after my morning workouts. We would all stay here again. And the price? Very reasonable. I am a SPG Gold Member (I travel a lot for work and love it!). For this trip, I booked an Executive Suite (online deal via SPG web site) for business. They gave me a standard room instead. After a short wait they were able to find a Corner Suite. However, even though this sounds great (and most other Sheraton's Corner Suites ARE great), this one smelled musty, dank and the best word I can think of is...icky... (when the manager met me with the key to this 2nd room - he even commented that it was \"musty\" and did I want housekeeping to \"spray it.\" I opted out of that masking solution. Anyway, it is not a very comfortable room overall.The worst part was the air conditioning, which not only sounds like a loud, rattling lawn mower in your room, but it also leaks (the carpet was wet - was nice stepping in that with stocking feet-yuck). When you turn it off it sounds like water torture (drip, drip, drip, drip...) dripping into the space/wall (I looked inside the wall vent and sure enough there was a puddle in there). I called and they were going to send engineering to fix the AC when I was away from the room working, but it was not fixed. Also, the room had an odd, very strong odor of cigarette smoke & BO upon my return. Again, ick. The bed was somewhat 'thin' and hard and there were no extra blankets. The tub water backs up to your calves when you take a shower (triple ick). I usually order room service, but the room was so dank and depressing and smelly and... icky :), I left to sit alone in the lobby restaurant. \n",
      "Positives: The Corner Suite is MASSIVE - and if you want space - that is what you get (albeit, not very comfy space). I have stayed at this hotel 4-5 times and the staff is always very pleasant and accommodating (when you have an issue they throw lots of points at you to 'fix' it - which is OK with me because I am a points hound, but I wish I didn't have to complain in the first place). Watching the planes land at LAX is fun from the room. The lobby is modern and bustling and the bar area is well laid out, which is a great place to people-watch, and although the service was sloooow, the food is decent 'bar' food. Starbucks in the lobby (but very long lines - out into the lobby - in the AM). Very easy to catch a cab at any time of day... I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could. The room itself was great. We're Platinum and got upgraded to a large suite with a separate sitting area. It's your basic airport sheraton, but plenty of space and the typical comfortable bed was just what we needed.\n",
      "Our experience would've been just fine, but the checkin process was awful. We arrived and while they did have the counter full with different employees, there was also a long line of people waiting. Since we're Platinum, we always go to the Starwood Preferred Guest line to checkin. We saw a sign for this and no one in line (one person being helped) and waited there. and waited, and waited. The woman who was at the counter saw us but not until we stepped up to the counter did she tell us that we needed to wait in the other line, the one with 8 people in it. We had already been waiting 10 minutes, which is unheard of at a Starwood. I said we were Platinum and were waiting in the spg line, she said, 'no, this is just a sign if you want to sign up for spg, the Preferred line is on the other side'. I asked her if there was anything she could do, as we'd been waiting a while in the wrong spot by this time. She just looked helpless. i was really upset at this point, walked over the preferred line and my husband got in the regular line - who knew at this point what would move faster. Luckily it was quick from there and the guy who checked us in had it down in 30 seconds. it's just too bad the woman couldn't have made more of an effort, or said something when we were standing there with suitcases for so long.\n",
      "We parked at the lot next to the hotel for $12 overnight, I'm sure parking at the hotel is much more so this was a good choice. While you could see the airport, we didn't have any noise. Stayed at this property as a 24hr stopover on our way back to Australia coming from NY & negotiated a late check out at no extra fee prior to arrival (similar to Sheraton 4 points LAX offer). Easy shuttle pick up/return at LAX (about 10mins most travel time), modern property with spacious room (BUT NEEDS A BAR FRIDGE IN THE ROOM AS STANDARD FACILITY), great buffet breakfast & very quiet being so close to the airport. There is self parking available in the street behind the property for up to 2 hrs or valet on site with a discount rate if you have a meal at the restaurant in the hotel. Would stay here again on our next trip thru LAX. I booked this room with a friend and arrived first. Was told that, although I had the proper ID, I couldn't get into the room because my name wasn't on the original paper, and I would have to wait in the lobby until my friend showed up. However, my soon to be son-in-law spoke with the front desk person and I was allowed up to the room.\n",
      " Once up there, the combination of flushing the toilet and then taking a shower caused the bathroom to flood and we needed to move to another room. The transfer was done quickly to a room on the same floor.\n",
      " We had breakfast the following morning in the hotel dining room. There was an all-encompassing buffet in the middle of the room for about $18, and one also had the option of ordering from the menu. I thought the food to be quite good.\n",
      " Checkout was at noon. We were getting off a 5 hour flight to LA before we had to embark on another 10 hour flight to the South Pacific. We booked the Sheraton Gateway hotel for a 12 rest between flights. We didn't expect much of the hotel, but were pleasantly surprised how well received we were at the hotel.\n",
      "1. As we were starting our honeymoon, I called ahead to book a cabana so we could relax by the pool and just decompress. I was told by the concierge desk that the hotel has a policy of not reserving cabanas. They are on a first come first serve basis. However, within the hour a hotel manager called me back to say that not only would they reserve a cabana for us, he was happy to offer us a couple of margharitas to welcome us to the hotel and wish us well on our (hours old) marriage. SCORE!\n",
      "2. I mistakenly booked this hotel on one of those third-party hotel booking sites. As a Starwood Points Collector I was devestated I wouldn't get any SPG credits for this stay. The front desk welcomed me as a Starwood Prefered member none the less and ensured I did receive my points for the stay. SCORE!\n",
      "3. After a hectic wedding week and long flight to LA, we decided to relax with Thai massages from the spa. We used the in-room massage services and I have to tell you they left no muscle unturned. It was a perfect way to end our stay at the hotel and on to our next 10 hour journey. SCORE!\n",
      "4. The shuttle service to LAX was easy to use and quick which was one less stress we needed to deal with during our stay. SCORE\n",
      "Overall, a great value, hotel and excellent service. We would stay there again. This place is all you really need for a stay at LAX. Only a 20 minute free bus ride from the airport. Check in was fast, rooms were huge and clean. Perfect.\n",
      "Best part about the rooms were the comfy beds and pillows! This hotel is listed as a 4 Star property on Priceline.com, but I think our group would say 3.5 stars. The room and bathrooms were clean, the linens were spotless, the bed was comfy, and we weren't bothered by the planes. Strangely enough though, we could hear the woman sneezing in the room next to us and the elevators going all night long. Thin interior walls, thick windows. This location hosts conventions, and we found the front desk and valet to be overwhelmed at times. \n",
      "We walked the pool area but didn't swim; it was quite nicely decorated and looked pristine. However the hotel bar was overpriced and watered down, food was eh. For perspective, I am local to Los Angeles, and place groups in hotels in that area regularly.\n",
      "For business or world travelers experiencing that short kind of layover where you simply check in and pass out in bed, one can't beat the Sheraton's proximity to the airport and comfortable rooms. I don't think it's quality differs from it's neighbors, the Westin or the Marriott. However if you have clients that want to see LA for a night, or at least have a decent meal before they head to bed, I would check out the Custom (walking distance to very good bars and restaurants, chic for clients, still within 5 minutes to LAX). Totally lacks atmosphere and lobby feels a bit empty, but the rooms are great, clean, well appointed and comfortable. Conveniently close to LAX, check in was fast and easy and shuttles in good supply. Not too much in immediate proximity for walking to. I was a first time guest at this hotel and had an excellent experience. From the moment I arrived, valet was courteous and helpful and check-in staff was professional and informative. I had to speak to the front desk manager (Milton) after checking out and he was the gaiety at customer service and problem solving. This hotel has great personnel and I look forward to staying here again in the future.\n",
      "Here is the after check-out story: I found myself in a snag after check-out with the EZ parking lot behind the hotel. The second vehicle we had was self-parked there and after trying to go back to retrieve it I experienced horrible customer service from the attendant and their representative over the phone. The attendant gave me 5 minutes to drop off the person driving the second vehicle and get out without being charged. I literally dropped her off and turned around to get out of the lot. Upon exit, the machine was charging me because it said I was there longer than the 5 minutes she gave me. I spoke to the attendant regarding this matter and her attitude completely changed. I then proceeded to call the 877 number on the call box and was greeted by another extremely rude employee who threatened to call the police on me. This is the time I called the hotel and spoke with the front desk manager (Milton) who resolved the matter expeditiously. DO NOT give this parking lot any more business by buying the pass in the hotel. The safest bet is to look for a different lot. Customer BEWARE at this lot!!!!!! Hosted a family reunion in the beginning of the month. Group rate was great and so was the service. From Zane Ocubillo the Convention Services Manager who was very accomodating to our family's needs, to the Estela Estrada who provided excellent wait service during our family reunion banquet and Elias Moscoso the director of banquets food and beverage. The food was absolutely delicious! and the rooms and facility was nicely renovated and very comfortable. LAX hotels, like most airport hotels, tend to be a bit on the utilitarian side. The Sheraton Gateway is, by far, the best of the bunch and goes the extra mile. Free internet, a beautiful pool and a lively bar are all things you don't expect in a higher end property. The rooms are well appointed, though the bathrooms are Sheraton Small. Overall, its a surprisingly excellent hotel, with a bad parking situation made worse by the new \"automated\" system that constantly screws up. The hotel was adequate. I have had better rooms at other Sheraton hotels. The room was clean, but the hall way was not. There were used room services dishes left in the hallway for a whole day, not picked up by staff. The hotel was quite for being so close to the airport. That was nice. \n",
      "The paid park was a nightmare. It is located about a 10 min walk behind the hotel. Also you have to use a very complicated daily card system. We are instructed not to loose the daily cards because we will have to pay for them again. But then the card doesn't always work in the machine, so we frequently have to call for assistance at the exit gate. Also the lot is shared with long-term airport parking and van pool parking, so good luck finding a space.\n",
      "The heated pool was great as were the pool side cabanas. So definitely check the pool out! Good airport hotel. The service at breakfast en the bell desk are slow. The rooms are too dark.\n",
      "The location is very good for an airport hotel. The price for this quality is good. Except that they charge you USD 28 for the Valetparking as a hotelguest. Hotel is good for a one night and then you head on. SPG is great in its treatment of Platinum members. The club lounge at the Gateway is great with nice food offerings and great service. My wife and I were even allowed to bring in our own bottle of wine to have with our \"dinner\", which really it was: there is certainly enough to fix a small meal on what they offer. The room was spacious but the bathroom was small. The halls are tired and certainly not up to the same standard as the lobby. The internet speed was fine for our purpose. The guest laundry on level three was appreciated; however the single washer and dryer could be augmented with another couple of machines and moved to a larger area. The price for the machines was $2.50 each. Stayed one night prior to early morning flight. Rooms are quiet, comfortable, and clean. Small bathroom and NO mini fridge. It has been a long time since I have been in a room without one. But, besides that it is modern and it has a nice outside area retreat. The pool is smaller, does not get too deep, and it has the smallest hot tub I have ever seen, but it is relaxing and they do a good job blocking out the airport. Food was good, drinks are overpriced. But, very convenient to LAX. Shuttle is prompt and no issues, even with young kids. Stayed here multiple times. Efficient, consistent, generally clean and comfortable hotel with compact, reasonably appointed rooms and good room service. Reasonable maintenance of standards given it's a Sheraton. Shuttle bus service to LAX is good for single travellers but a little difficult if you are travelling with a young family....but let's face it, there is nothing easy about travelling with a young family. I would stay here next time I need an LAX hotel. First off, our stay at the Sheraton was wonderful. We stayed here on our wedding night and everyone from the valet guys to the bell hop treated us with the utmost kindness and hospitality. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfy! We ordered breakfast from the restaurant downstairs (to go) and it was delicious! \n",
      "Secondly, my husband and I were lucky enough to check-in and be greeted by Mustafa at the counter. He and his team (including Gian, Rudy, Edwards and Greg) were polite, helpful and accommodating. We recognize good customer service when we receive it, and Mustafa certainly set the bar. When we returned from our honeymoon to get our car and had lost the ticket for parking, not only did he remember us from check-in, he immediately solved our problem and helped us get on our way.\n",
      "We will return for future stays near the airport! This hotel serves it's purpose as an overnight stay when you arrive at LAX airport and need to catch a connection the nest morning. Just few minutes ride in a fee shuttle from the terminal. I would not stay there unless I have to. Long waiting at the reception desk for check in. Quick checkout though. No personal attitude of the staff. Old rooms. In conclusion - an average Airport\n",
      "hotel. Nothing to write home about ! I'd taken a look at the reviews and tripadvisor, and picked this hotel based on the reviews. I was not disappointed, and if I were needing to stay in LA near the airport again would definitely pick the same hotel.\n",
      "The inside is nicely fitted, and the guy working on the front desk provided an excellent service checking us in, and explain a few things...set a good tone...\n",
      "The rooms are quite nice, and the bar and restaurant are both nice with a balance of quality and value.\n",
      "The only minor negative on the whole stop was in the morning when I came to use the coffee filter in the room and there was no coffee...bit annoying, but hey its never that great anyway ;-) We stayed here for one night as it was close to the airport. I guess I had it in my mind that the Sheraton hotels were amazing, maybe I built it up too much in my mind but this place was just okay really. \n",
      "In terms of price it's quite expensive to stay here, the rooms don't really match the price though. While they are a very large size and the beds are comfortable they seem a bit old and second rate, not the usual Sheraton standard. \n",
      "The bathrooms are old and quite small, our shower got clogged and we had to call house keeping. Also, someone had been smoking in our room and it had to be deoderised by house keeping.\n",
      "Room service is very average, I wouldn't really recommend eating here, you're better off to catch the trolley cart service to manhatten beach for food. \n",
      "The concierge guy was bored, uninterested and made us feel like we had done something wrong by speaking to him. \n",
      "But overall it's not a bad place to stay, just didn't feel like it lived up to the amount of money we paid for it. I actually thought the Ibis airport hotel at Gatwick London was far better than the Sheraton in LA and it was a LOT cheaper. Stayed at this hotel last minute as we missed our connection. This reservation was made via a phone at LAX out of desperation for a clean place to stay after AA would not pay to put me up in a hotel I found this one. Initially I had called Radison there was no availability and this was the next hotel brand that I could find that I would consider staying at. I usually research all hotels ahead of time so staying here was on a whim. Arrived at 1am and had to check out at 5am asked on the phone when making the reservation if they had a hourly rate reservation agent said no so I agreed to pay $189 for a hotel room for a couple of hours to get some shut eyes and a clean shower. We waited awhile for the shuttle and saw several hotel shuttles pass us twice before the Sheraton shuttle arrived. Upon arrival at the hotel there was a long line at the desk which I was wondering what was taking so long at 1st there was only one agent then another came it took 30 min to get through the line by then I was agitated however the agent was friendly and gave me a reduced rate as I told him I would be there a couple of hours. I appreciated that. The rooms were renovated and nice however the bathrooms haven't been renovated yet. Overall good last minute hotel stay. I am giving this place an average review because I have had the same issue three times while staying there. I usually stay at this property before a flight out of LAX. However, every time I stay I request a wakeup call, and it never comes. Thankfully I set my back up alarm on my most recent trip, or I would have missed my plane. Little things like this make a big difference to business travelers. \n",
      "Overall the property is nice and the beds are comfortable as most Sheraton properties. The restaurant and bar are nice, but a tad overpriced. I had a drink and a sandwich and it was $30 dollars. \n",
      "However, the property is a good value for that looking to park and fly, and it is like three minutes from LAX. There is a bit of airline noise depending on what side of the property you are on, but the rooms are pretty quiet none the less. Over the last five years I have stayed in most of the hotels on Century Blvd and surrounding area and this is by far the nicest. I now stay here exclusively, often for extended periods of time. The rooms are nice and updated (the suites are extremely roomy and quiet), food is great, and pool and gym are the best around. Even though all the admenities are attractive, the aspect that always stands out to me is how friendly and helpful the staff are at every level! They have gone above and beyond to accomodate me on each of my stays whether it has been solo for business or with my family. Very restful and quiet. Nice pool deck. Nice business center. Rooms are well appointed and have free Starbucks coffee in-room. The concierge service is very helpful as well. All in all, you won't be disapointed. We stayed here for one night- we had previously stayed at another Starwood property nearby. The Sheraton is by far the better property. First of all, it did not feel crowded at all- though there were a lot of people staying there, conferences, etc. The lobby is laid out in a way that you don't feel like it is a convention center. There is a lounge to one side, and some really long and comfortable sofas on another. Great fitness center- best I have ever seen. Lots of new and well maintained equipment. Pool area was nice- almost like a resort. Room was very nice- nice size, bed and chairs were comfortable, and well lit.Parking- a little problematic. Valet is real expensive- $32. There is a lot behind the hotel for $15 with in/out privileges. It is a little bit of a walk to the hotel, but I didn't mind it. But some people would not like this. All in all, a nice stay. If you are staying near LAX and have Starwood points- in my opinion, this is the better choice. We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway for the convenience of being near the airport. We paid for an upgrade to allow us to use the lounge. The room was very ordinary and tired with no fridge.\n",
      "The suprise came when we used the lounge. We had to pay for the wine and were given a slip on which to charge a tip for service. The woman in lounge on our first trip was brusque and surly. To add insult to injury the coffee machine broke down on our first day and it wasn't fixed for the 3 days we were there. The payment for an upgrade was a waste of money. Hearing others talking in the lounge it was apparent that a large number had got their upgrade for free.\n",
      "The hotel was in an excellent position to watch the aircraft landing and we were pleasantly suprised at how quiet it was. Parking was in the airport public parking area which was not very convenient\n",
      "Memmi It was my very first time in LA. The night before departure, I decided to book a hotel close to LAX. I totally didn't know what to expect, but the staff was so very courteous as well as helpful with my many questions. Hours before checkout, I needed special assistance, in which Ms. Cheeks was soo very nice to me. She went above and beyond my request. She, as well as all the Sheraton LAX staff must have been hand picked because I have never experienced an entire staff that was so professional. Thank you very much Ms. Cheeks.\n",
      "R. J.\n",
      "Monroe, LA Estela Estrada enhanced my stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX. She's extremely friendly, attentive, and responsive. She made sure I was comfortable, had everything I needed including my OJ at breakfast and my Diet Coke at lunch. Estela made me feel like a queen and I appreciate her quality of service. Thank you Estela. first cannot understand review \"needs overhall\" we as a family( of four plus infant) checked in at 2pm after reserving hotel from LAX terminal, earlier than stated, NO problem, shuttle bus NO problem, was dealt with at front desk NO problem, room club standard in sheraton, club lounge very helpfull, super freindly hostess, bar in lobby safe and welcoming, checked out next day no hassle, good price too, would not hesitate to recomend as short layover stop. We recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX as a layover on a trip between Australia and the eastern Canada. Having stayed at a couple of LA airport hotels on different trips, this is by far our favourite choice and we are unlikely to go elsewhere unless they let us down in the future.\n",
      "This trip, we (family of 5, kids aged 7, 3 and 5 months) arrived in LA at 10:30 a.m. after a 14 hour flight from Sydney. The shuttle arrived promptly and the driver was very helpful with our crazy luggage (carseat, 3 suitcases and a multitude of carry ons).\n",
      "We were greeted warmly on arrival and the only problem arising from our early check in was the ability to get adjoining rooms at that time. However, they helpful check in person said that for a $70 upgrade fee, we could get an adjoining room with a corner suite. We took this option (our original two room booking made on hotels.com was only $300 for two rooms, which we were feeling was a great deal) and our $70 was money well spent. We had a gorgeous room overlooking all the activity of LAX and the suite room afforded us plenty of room to spread out (the kids played hide and seek!) and rest before the next leg of our journey. \n",
      "A crib was delivered to us promptly. The rooms were nicely appointed and the beds and furniture comfortable.\n",
      "Our kids like the pool which is nicely (albeit not perfectly) maintained and pleasant to sit at. The bar adjoins and food is served to you at the pool, which we really like. The bar food is totally acceptable with (as is so often the case) massive portions.\n",
      "There is free wifi on the lobby floor of the hotel (not accessible as high as the 4th floor on which we were located). There is also a Starbucks in the lobby. \n",
      "Although we didn't do it this time, there is a trolley that takes you from just outside the hotel to Manhatten for $5 (last we did it) which was well worth the trip and a great stopover outing.\n",
      "As far as airport hotels go, this is a great one with pleasant staff, good service, comfortable rooms and good amenities. As a frequent traveller you sometimes get in a bind for reservations - I dealt with Peter Muema and he was able to solve all my problems quickly - that kind of service is hard to come by these days. I will be coming back and will make The Sheraton Gateway LA my hotel of choice. We always stay at the Sheraton Gateway at LAX Airport when we visit LA. We are also Gold Status with SPG. But when ever we check into this property, we never get moved up or get even a big Hello when we check in as Gold SPG members. Second for some odd reason, we seem to get a $50 pet chg, at every stay over. The problem is the front desk staff, seems to blow over it and make it as if it was part of all the charges (tax etc.) Weird. We tried to speak to a front desk mgr, on check out at 10 am Sat. morning, and they said there was No mgr. in the building at that time. Now on the other side, we needed to rent another room for our adult kids to visit, and Anca Shama was very helpful in getting us a clean room at that early hour. So Thanks Anca ! Stayed here for an overnight before flight. The Sheraton has nice and modern rooms, they are also very quite. 2 restaurants and the bar offer lunch and dinner. There is also a nice pool and gym. From the pool you can see planes flying into LAX. Stuff is friendly. I do however not understand why internet is charged at 15USD per day, today every low cost hotel offers high speed internet free of charge. The airport shuttle leaves every 15min and is free of charge. This hotel is located close to LAX and there's a hotel shuttle bus to take you from and to the airport. The hallway that our room was situated looked a little bit rundown so we were a bit apprehensive when we opened the door to our room. It was OK though and there was a coffee machine with Starbucks coffee, which cheered me up (there's also a Starbucks in the lobby area). The room was clean and the beds were fine, but the bathroom looked horrible - like something you would find at a cheap motel. It was, though, perfectly clean. To sum up then, if you just need one night of accommodation near the airport before moving on, it's OK. I stay at this hotel 10-12 times per year on business. The location for business gives you access to all of the slow moving LA highways. As for the hotel, management is very responsive, rooms are always very clean and all staff is very accommodating. The pricing is perfect for business. Best yet is that after work hours, easy access to Manhattan Beach, Marina Del Rey, Santa Monica, Culver City, Hermosa Beach etc - all without ever going on the 405. It is your standard Sheraton by an airport, but there is comfort knowing that Sheratons have been renovated recently. Stayed here for two nights in July and received a complimentary upgrade, so all was good. Ran into some mechanical issues with the HVAC, but maintenance fixed it in no time at all. \n",
      "Check-in can be a wait, but friendly staff more than makes up for it. \n",
      "Within walking distance of the terminals at LAX, but they also offer a complimentary shuttle which seems to run nonstop. If you have some time and don't have a car, the Ocean Express trolley takes you over to Manhattan Beach and surrounding shopping locations for only $5 r/t. Pick up a ticket at the valet stand. I stayed here at the end of a business trip with an early flight out of LAX the next morning. Check in was smooth. The room was clean. I'm a little heavy sleeper, but if there was any plane noise outside overnight, I didn't hear it.\n",
      "I used the gym downstairs which was one of the nicer hotel gyms I've been to. Plenty of equipment to use and different varieties.\n",
      "I was comped a buffet breakfast in one of the restaurants. Don't remember if that was from when I booked the hotel online or at check in. The breakfast was great, it was buffet style with a wait staff for drinks.\n",
      "The shuttles to the airport were convenient and smooth. We stopped at another hotel before going to the airport, but overall it was good.\n",
      "I would definitely consider staying here when flying out of LAX again. This was a typical Sheraton. It is very close to airport. Self park was expensive and a very long walk. I got the room through Priceline for $ 78 In general this is a very good stay for the money. No complaints. Recent visit required a day stay here and perhaps that was the reason, but the room allocated was just 'worn out'. Bathroom looked instituitonal, with cracks and faded. It needs an upgrade. I just wanted to note what wonderful staff there is at the Sheraton Gateway in LA. I was leading a workshop and my office forgot to send copies of my powerpoint and Paul came to the rescue- he copied my rather long powerpoint and as his copier did not collate, he put the presentation together by hand and saved my workshop!! He was very good natured about the whole thing and was heroic under pressure. Thanks, Paul!! This is pretty much your average Sheraton. The rooms and furniture are about what one might expect from a run of the mill Sheraton hotel. I did have a few nits that I wanted to point out. 1.) the rooms overlook the LAX runway and you can constantly hear planes taking off, even throughout the wee hours 2.) the bathrooms are a bit tired and could use some TLC. 3.) the water pressure leaves a bit to be desired and will leave those in need of a good strong shower disappointed - I stayed on a high floor so perhaps this was the culprit, at least in part 4.) the showers seem to have been designed for a person of midgential stature, with the shower head mounted about nipple-high despite relatively tall bathroom ceilings, which I found aggravating. Other than that the hotel is overly average and I am not entirely sure why it's ranked in the top 5% of all LA hotels. Perhaps the fact that there is an airport hotel that is not totally abysmal is a feat worth celebrating. Good environment! The lobby is nice. Great place to stay the night before flight. Arrived at the hotel after a 21 hour + flight from Asia at about 10pm, only to encounter a 6+ person line to checkin. Only two staff on duty, and one seemed to like being away from the counter for 1015 minutes at a time. Also, folks would stand in the gold/platinum line and get served ahead of the rest of us scum in the regular line. I know for a fact that at least one of these line jumpers was definetely not a preferred guest. After about 50 minutes, I reached the desk where the clerk checked me in and, to his credit, did give us free breakfast coupons. \n",
      "I am used to bell-boys meeting us upon arrival with 4 suitcases, but this was not the case here. I did find them in the lobby lounging around, but offering no assistance to guests. I carried my own suitcases to the room.\n",
      "The room itself was good, but was disappointed to find that a business hotel such as this did not have an in-room safe, nor a mini-bar. Guess I am spoiled with the international hotels. \n",
      "Slept well, bathroom was good. Breakfast was actually quite good, with excellent service. Overall, I am disappointed because this is a Sheraton property. They need some tune-up on the staff, but hotel was fine. Stayed here once for business, just one night, that was enough. Not a great value for the price, parking rates are high, food was just OK, but when you need a room in a pinch beggars can't be choosy. Bed was comfortable, bathroom clean, lobby area clean but staff is a little stand-offish. I know my way around the area pretty well so was able to amuse myself by taking a drive down to Manhattan Beach to enjoy the sunset and dinner. We arrived to LAX and choose this hotel for the proximity to the airport and looking for a Hotel brand that can give you quality in your stay. The beds were fine, the bathroom was clean. No complains about the room. However the atmosphere in the main floor and around the lobby was nothing warm, the agents at the front desk were more soldiers than friendly. They were descent but they never showed a smile, or Good morning, you know those things that make the difference between a good hotel and an average one…. Another thing is the parking, unless you are going to use their valet parking, there is no parking for the guest of this hotel, so be prepared to pay around $13 per night in an independent parking lot behind the hotel. Recommend it only if you are looking a place where to sleep... ONE Night !!! My collegues and I frequent the Sheraton Gateway lobby bar for one reason, Gabriela S. She always makes us (and everyone) feel like they are the only people in the place, and it is always full of professionals winding down after a hard day. The crowd is great, but Gabriela determines to know your name and address you by it. she goes out of her way to do things to make you feel special. she is the reason we book hotel rooms and don't go anyplace for drinks and food except the lobby bar!! This was a great hotel! Beautiful and clean and about 25 minutes to everything...Rodeo Drive, The Grove, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, 3rd st Promenade and Hollywood. The staff was friendly, everyday they gave us easy directions to everything we wanted to see and gave us great ideas to other attractions. Would recommnend this hotel to anyone! This is our second stay at this hotel. We either got the same room, or all the rooms smell of B.O. Couldn't sit on the sofa because of the smell. It was in the carpet as well. Otherwise, great hotel. Comfortable beds. Great food, great service. Have stayed here twice now in between flights to Austin, TX. The hotel is very average at best. The airport is loud, which is fine, but $20 a day for WiFi that's SLOWER than dial up is ridiculous. If this is meant to be a business hotel then the WiFi should WORK, be FAST and FREE. Seriously, it's not 2004 any more. Hotels like this really need to lift their game. Won't be staying here again. I stayed here for one night in May 2012. The room charge was $205. Today I learned that a room can be had on Expedia for $130. Their two restaurants are very expensive e.g 2 cocktails $40.\n",
      "Although the room was nice, I wish to warn people about the expenses.\n",
      "I will not stay here again. Very nice 4 star Sheraton Hotel directly overlooking LAX runways. We specified upper level with full runway view and were very happy, as we are airplane enthusiasts. Front desk comped wifi (usually $12) because I am Starwood member. Valet parking is $28 but we self parked behind hotel for $13 with in and out privileges. Great place for an overnight. Best housekeeping service I've ever had! Teresa Ortez treated me like a guest in her own house. She figured out my routine and adapted the room to it - moved the floor lamps to the area I set up my laptop, put linens on the table I eat on, etc. It was fantastic!\n",
      "I've been traveling to LA for 6 months and have stayed at almost every hotel in the area. This one was the first to make me feel like a \"guest\" - not just a traveler. Hats off to their amazing housekeeping staff! checked in at the Sheraton Gateway LAX, Amiable Diane at the guest services was very welcoming and accomodated my needs and request promptly which generally made my stay relaxing.\n",
      "Mustapha, a very nice gentle man. My reserved room smelled like previous guest had smoked in it. and Mustapha was very apologetic and moved me to a different room, and of course offerred me some Sheraton's rebates. Its amazing he rememebered enrolling me last year in SPG.\n",
      "I cant get enough of Sheraton's Gateway LAX Hospitality. Sheraton Gateway recently changed their LAX shuttle service provider. I sat and waited about 45 minutes for a shuttle, watching their competitors' shuttles pass me by over and over. Finally a Sheraton shuttle arrived, nearly full. We bypassed the last two LAX terminals because because the shuttle was full. When I arrived at the hotel, the line to check in was half way to the door. Fortunately I was at the front of the shuttle, because by the time the shuttle was unloaded the line reached the door. I waited in line almost an hour to check in; I pity the poor guys at the back of that line. Absolute incompetence at the check in desk, but friendly. The room, food, etc. was good -- typical for this class of hotel. This was serious luxury after 6 weeks bumming around Europe. Loved the space, towels, cleanliness and super friendly staff. I have stayed at this property a few times. I have never had anything but great service. \n",
      "Diane who answers the phone is always so sweet,The ladies at the front counter always watch my bill to make sure I am not charged for the free Internet ( I am a state employee and get free internet) when I forget to.\n",
      " I had an issue with my heat not working, in less than 3 min they had a very nice man come to fix it.. even in the Starbucks area they remember me and what I drink, WOW, I have never had such great service, in all the years I have been traveling.. must stay here if you have the opportunity, AND the hotel is beautiful!!!! My husband and I stayed here for one night because we found a good deal online and love the Manhattan Beach area (We live about 45 minutes away).\n",
      "We checked in around 9:30 PM and were a little confused about where to leave our car while checking in since the front seemed like it was all reserved for valet and we weren't planning on using valet. But my husband just waited while I ran it. Check-in was fast though. Probably the biggest disappointment with the hotel is that the non-valet parking is not on sight. It's an airport lot right next door. I knew when I booked that parking was $15 a night, I would just rather it be on the property. The lot is literally next door and is only about a 2 minute walk from the front of the hotel... it's just not my ideal situation. It was gated and felt safe enough though, so don't let that be a real deterrent. \n",
      "Our room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool, then past that the parking lot, and past that the LAX runway (so if you're staying at this hotel for a flight - you're definitely in the right place)\n",
      "The room was clean, modern, comfortable and basically everything you'd expect from this caliber hotel. The walls are gray with modern furniture and you might consider it a little \"cold\" but I'll take that over a cheesy, and outdated any day. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom had plenty of counter space and the closet was a good size. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the room and it was a very nice place to stay.\n",
      "I was SUPER excited to learn that the pool/jacuzzi were open until midnight so we headed down as soon as we checked in. Surprisingly there were several people down there already and the jacuzzi was pretty full so we tested the pool water and it was so warm! Even though it was July, it can get pretty chilly that close to the beach at night so I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and comfortable it was to just step right into the pool. We eventually used the jacuzzi and it was great. Hot with good jets. \n",
      "We didn't use the fitness center but I looked at it and it's huge! Several treadmills and ellipticals all with individual TVs. \n",
      "In the morning we used the business center to get directions and as guests it looked like you could use the internet for 45 minutes for free. \n",
      "We didn't use any of the other services but the bar/restaurant had people in it every time we were in the lobby so it looked popular. \n",
      "We were definitely very sad we couldn't stay longer and would definitely return and recommend the Sheraton Gateway to our friends! Ask for the \"quiet side\" or you may end up with the side with runway\n",
      "Starbucks inside\n",
      "Great for airport stay very close. \n",
      "Overall great place but really needs to update the guest room plumbing fixtures-all of them. \n",
      "Only two negatives (but not bad enough to keep me from going back)\n",
      "1. Very old faucets (but clean) that squeaked when opened and loose. The toilets make way too much noise when they fill and take too long. Shower head very hart to adjust (too much hard water buildup on the face). Just replace all your plumbing, it’s not up the Sheraton standards.\n",
      "2. Parking is way behind the property across the street for $13.50 per day, unless you want to valet for $30 (but I guess in LA that’s to be expected)\n",
      "But like I already said, I’ll go back, the guest bathroom were very clean and well maintained otherwise. Another wonderful stay at the Sheraton Gateway! Thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay and felt right at home during my two nights there. The staff was professional and courteous; from the concierge to the valet parking team to the bell hops, check in/registration members, the Lounge, Bar, and more. Mustafa did a great job of taking care of my reservation and ensuring that no detail went unnoticed. Had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Peter Muema, travel sales manager, and he is a fine Sheraton and Starwood representative. I really look forward to returning soonest! Thank you!! I was recently in Los Angeles on business and stayed at the Sheraton Gateway near LAX. The hotel was clean, comfortable, well appointed and welcoming. We utilized their meeting facilities and found everything was in good order, well prepared and ready to go when we were.\n",
      "The rooms were comfortable, quiet (nice since LAX is right down the street) and clean. So, far! this is one of the best hotel in the LAX area. Decent breakfast, overall good service for Gold/Platinum members,. Excellent, club lounge and nice airport view. \n",
      "The rooms are large, nice pool and excellent fitness center. Overall, Liked it! I stay here everytime I have an early morning flight out of LAX and have always had a good experience . However , this time was a disaster.3 calls downstairs for a robe and 1 1/2 hours later ,no robe. They could not tell me what time the airport shuttle comes \n",
      "They would not transfer me to the General Managers voicemail ,but I did talk to his assistant the next day and he still will not call me back. As a Platinum member,this is unacceptable. I am writing to share my overwhelming satisfaction with the excellent customer service by Diane Cheek who works for Sheraton Gateway - Los Angeles. She was very pleasant and made sure that all my questions were answered. Its extremely refreshing to come across individuals such as Diane who enjoy their job and provide service with a smile. Thanks Diane!!! :) Due to flight delay, we were coming in later than our other family member. We called ahead and all we wanted was to add our brother name to the reservation (so that he can check in rather than sitting in the lobby for 5 additional hour waiting for us to show up).\n",
      "That was all we asked for, yet the hotel receptionist (whoever answered the call) decided that it wasn't a right thing to do (to add another name ?), and gave us a run around (called different numbers, spoke to different person, etc ...). At the end, our brother still ended up wasting 5 hr and 45 min, since the hotel decided that they couldn't accomodate adding another name. How that for a service? Never again at this hotel, and we will be sure this experience will be on our Facebook network so everyone else will know. We stayed at this hotel with our toddler for 5 nights during an event. The hotel is really designed for those staying over for one night between flights, but the staff were friendly. For multi-night stays, one needs to ask for the room to be cleaned, for towels to be replaced, etc. I made a reservation for a crib and fridge in the room a week prior to our reservation, but we did not know until day of arrival whether either would be available. The valets let us leave our car out front for an hour or so at a time for nap times and loading/unloading with our toddler - this was really helpful. The pool area was good for a toddler - there were people sunning around the pool, but no one seemed too put off by a splashing, squeaky toddler in the pool. There was a large, open area downstairs with free wi-fi that was a fun space for our toddler to run and explore, inside. Flight was cancelled and ended up here for a night. It worked well: good large room, nice atmosphere, free wifi, lovely open areas downstairs, very comfortable bed. The gym wasn't enormous but wasn't full. The brasserie served a *delicious* lunch. And a free shuttle to the airport but then that's no different to all LAX hotels. Late check out requested and not a problem at all (and not an extra charge like Hilton's often try and pull on you). \n",
      "A good introduction to Sheraton and recommended if you need a place at LAX for a night or two. I stayed in the hotel only a night before my flight back to Taiwan...\n",
      "Front desk staffs arent too friendly and also unhelpful..My friend and I had a lot of luggages yet the bellboy did nothing to help us..The room was clean though.\n",
      "One good point was that their airport shuttle was always on-time and we didnt need to contact the hotel staff to make appointment for it. My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights - the hotel is very nice and clean and the rooms are almost exactly the same to a number of other Sheraton's that we have stayed at in North America. There is a self-park pay lot behind the hotel for $14 per day (valet is $30 per day). Would recommend if looking to stay in the LAX area. I keep trying different LAX hotels when I have an overnight layover, and the Sheraton is the best so far in terms of price and comfort. Staff was helpful, room was mostly functional, although AC and telephone could be better. Desk chair is not adjustable and window doesn't open, but the club floor breakfast was adequate, as were the in-room amenities. Hotel room could have been cleaner--bathroom OK, but phone was dirty and everything a bit dusty. Considering the location, it is quiet. My daughter and I recently took a cruise from Los Angeles to Vancouver. We decided to go to LA a couple days early to relax and explore the area other than Disneyland where we have already visited. The concierge (Albert) was super and full of great suggestions. He advised us that for $5 hop-on-hop-off trolley fare we could go south to Manhattan Beach. Ticket good for 24 hours. Got on the trolley in front of the hotel. What at great place. We visited the beach front area and the shops. Got back on the trolley and got off at the Manhattan Village shopping center for awhile. Nice place also and a great little restaurant with happy hour drinks and appys at really good prices. A rum and coke for $2.95 The next day we took Albert`s advice again and for $1.00 we got a city bus just across the street from the hotel parking lot. Sure it took us through the city north to Santa Monica but that was interesting also. Trip was about 30 minutes going but more on the return trip as we got caught in the rush hour traffic. Beware - you need to leave the Santa Monica area by about 2:30. We left at 3:00 and we were in the beginning of the busy traffic. But...Santa Monico is really nice. An entire area is cobblestone pedetrian area only with bistro tables and street musicians and lots of great boutique stores for shopping as well as a mall with Nordstroms. Of course, the pier at the beach area has the Palisades Park with ferris wheel and roller coaster too ! Both of these very inexpensive options were a great adventure. Loved both Manhattan Beach and Santa Monica. You can swim at both places but for us in May was still too cool but there were some people on the beach and in the water. Looked like there were life guard towers also. For sure all along Manhattan Beach. Well located, good staff, rooms are pretty standard but certainly more than adequate for 1-2 nights in LA if you need to be close to LAX - I can recommend this place. The hotel is close to the airport and check-in after midnight was quick and easy. We waited a while for the shuttle, but that could have been due to our late arrival time. The shuttles during the day appeared run very frequently. We had a club room which was a nice room and very clean, however, you could hear a lot noise from planes flying in and out of LAX which was disappointing. The breakfast in the club lounge was very mediocre, we were aware it was only a continental breakfast, and to our disappointment the croissants and danish were stale both mornings. The ors d'heuvres in the evening were a nice selection. The service in the club lounge was very cold and the staff were not very attentive. Average stay not over the top - although all Sheratons should be above average. Got this room for $120 on Priceline so Im pleased. Front desk and room service very nice and accomodating. Valet people were good as well. Room smelled like food when we arrived and we were not close to the restaurant. I did hear the conference call the guy next door was on at 7 am - that was not cool. Walls must be thin. Didnt hear the planes that I could see out of the window but did hear all my neighbor's biz. The Sheraton Gateway is super close to car rental returns and to LAX. We found it to be clean and have good service. The noise level between the rooms was high though I have to say - we had some VERY noisy neighbors (but I suspect they would have seemed noisy in any hotel). The room was well appointed and clean. I stayed for one night at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel. I arrived late in the evening and left early the next morning, so most of my time in the hotel was spent sleeping. The hotel has a dedicated shuttle, but it is currently undergoing a transition. If I hadn’t stumbled across the notice on the website that the shuttle says “EZ Park LAX,” I might have missed it. I appreciated the fact that the hotel runs constantly during certain hours of the day, rather than waiting to be called. The ride from the airport to the hotel takes about 10 minutes, depending on which terminal you board from.\n",
      "Check-in was fast and efficient. I walked past the bar and restaurant area in the lobby, which was surprisingly lively for a Sunday night. The room was clean and comfortable, but certainly nothing special. Internet access was free and worked perfectly, which was terrific. In the morning I opened the curtains and realized just how close to the airport I was: I could see the flight operations on the runway. I had an early departure, so I checked out quickly, got a coffee from the on-premise Starbuck’s, surfed the Internet for free in the lobby, and took the shuttle back to the airport.\n",
      "If you are visiting Los Angeles for sightseeing you should certainly not stay here, as it is far from the main tourist attractions. The area is dark and lonely in the evening, with few dining options within walking distance. It’s easier if you have a car, but I think most people staying at an airport hotel probably don’t have cars. I had to call guest services twice and had very prompt responses and a kind follow up call. Diane Cheeks sent me a tooth brush and tooth paste up in less than 5 minutes! The customer service is terrific ! Associate Stephen Dycus really made us feel at home ! I will stay here on my next business trip to L.A. ! I came to the Sheraton Gateway on a slightly extended stay and needed to dine inside the hotel several times. Although the dining hours of the lobby-level Paparazzi Restaurant are a bit limited (Mon-Sat 5:30-10pm, closed Sunday), the quality and presentation of the food are spectacular. What was really wonderful about my stay was the housekeeping. When I was in the room, the housekeeping staff was always unobtrusive at best and polite/friendly at worst. They are also very attentive toward any unforeseen urgencies (make sure to phone Diane for special requests - she's excellent!), and they accommodate scheduling needs as much as possible (*knock knock* \"Oh, I'm about to hop into the shower; please come back in 20 minutes\"). All in all, a quite nice stay at a great price. I would stay here again for the hotel's chic amenities, thorough housekeeping, and proximity to LAX. That is a nice big hotel. The service is ok if you compare with other hotels 5 star. Anyway I recommend if you don't want to spend a lot of money, if you rent a car or if you lide big hotels. The faculty was very attentative and nice. Diane Cheek, especially, was a wonderful problem solver and approached every question I had with much concern. This kind of professionalism and great attitude is what brings me back as a reoccurring customer. Thank you. Quick Stop in LAX overnight before leaving to Mexico early in the morning.\n",
      "Good and convenient location and better then alot of hotels near the airport. OK, so I'm biased. I'm a loyal SPG customer and try to stay at the Sheraton Gateway for my LA travel. I'm fussy about hotels. On first inspection some people might be turned off by a hotel near a large airport. Many flight crews stay here and the hotel is often booked for conventions. The management and staff of the Sheraton Gateway really get super customer service. I've never experienced this level of service at an airport hotel. I was upgraded to an executive suite - nice surprise. During past stays at this hotel, I have always ventured to the beach towns for dinner. Last week I decided to stay put and eat in the hotel restaurant, Paparazzi. I'm glad I did. The food was incredible! Stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX recently.\n",
      "The hotel is well located and is within walking distance to fast dood restaurants like In-N-Out Burger etc..and a Mini Mart convenience store around the corner.\n",
      "The hotel is clean and quiet and there is a Starbucks located within the lobby of the hotel.\n",
      "There are rooms that over look the runway's of LAX and provide excellent views of aircraft taking and landing.\n",
      "Just up from the hotel is transport to Manhattan Beach is on the main road- West Century Boulevard.\n",
      "There is free WiFi within the lobby and a bank of PC's also in the corner of the lobby.\n",
      "They are free to use as well as the printers.\n",
      "The free shuttle bus service to LAX is quick and efficient. We stayed at this hotel for four nights over Memorial Day weekend. It is a typical airport hotel with the noise of the airport. However, the hotel itself is nice. It has a good Italian restaurant and the bar is open late and serves food until 1 a.m. The room was clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly. The biggest complaint is valet parking is expensive and self park is a block away and also not cheap. The club level is OK but nothing exciting for breakfast. This is an above average airport hotel. We stayed at this hotel 5/19 for two nights just as a stop over. The room was just ok. Beds were comfortable and clean. Parking is inconvient and run but an outside company that provides long term parking for the airport. They charge 13.00/day. No free wi-fi in the rooms which is exremely disappointing escpecially considering they offer it in the lobby. Why not let your visitors \"enjoy\" the comforts of their room? At any rate, my husband and I were debating whether or not to pay 12.95 for the wi-fi or go sit downstairs in the lobby. I called the front desk and asked them if the fee was per room or per device. He told me it was per room. We decided to go ahead and pay. Ended up they charged us for each device. They did give me a credit but not after making me feel like I was not be truthful about my conversation. They asked me to provide a name of who I spoke to. Sorry.. I assume your front desk staff is reliable and didn't realize I needed proof! When I travel again, I doubt I would stay here again. There is another Sheraton (Four Points) not far from here that had free wi-fi and much more accomodating to their guests. There are frequent free shuttle busses from the airport. Our room overlooked the runway. One can hear the planes but it's not too noisy and has to be expected in an airport hotel. Staff was very friendly. Our room was quite nice but had no fridge and no safe. There was hair in the bathroom and so much long blond hair on the chairs that I didn't even want to put my bag on the chairs! Breakfast buffet was fantastic. A bus terminal is only 10 minutes walk away and even though the busses take a long time one can reach Santa Monica Pier in about 45 minutes depending on the traffic. We had to pay for an extra half day to be able to shower and check out late before our onward flight. They charged us room service we never had and it took a while to sort it out. Nevertheless.........if one has to spend a night or two near LAX before the next flight this isn't a bad hotel for a short stay. Stayed here again last week. First stayed in 2009 and was impressed.\n",
      "We were surprised that there was no free wi-fi in the rooms. You either have to pay for the priviledge, or head down to the lobby for free access. The hotel has a very good computer area with several PCs & printers if you don't have your own device.\n",
      "Hotel is well equipped with a pleasant bar (although this can make the lobby noisy at times) and a pool and spa area. Great views of the LAX runways if you are a plane spotter.\n",
      "Beds are wonderfully comfortable, and rooms are clean and well appointed as you would expect from a Sheraton. \n",
      "Surprisingly, the hotel does not offer a hospitality room or a locker room where you can shower and change if you have a late flight. The only alternatives are paying for a late check-out or not showering. A word of warning : do not leave clothes on hangers with the bell staff, leave only suitcases. My ironed business shirt on a hanger was missing when I collected my luggage. The shirt was eventually found and handed to me - crushed and without explanation or apology.\n",
      "There is a Starbucks in the lobby and a Subway next door. A short walk away is In and Out Burger and a mini-mart.\n",
      "The shuttle to LAX is very frequent. Is allways a wonderful experience from the parking to the front desk especially when Im greeted by Eddie Rayas he has excellent customer service. Nothing special. Clean, fast service. Easy to reach with shuttle. Room service and food good. Stopped 2 nights arriving from New Zealand before road-tripping to Houston while emigrating. \n",
      "With 2 small children and picking up our lap-dog from cargo on the second day, this was a very welcoming place to stay for the beginning of our long trek.\n",
      "We were a little confused about the shuttle from the airport as they had emailed to say they had \"changed shuttle services\" just before we flew; so we were a little unsure of which shuttle to be looking for and there was no-one around to ask at the airport; at least who would know comprehensively about hotel shuttles since there are so many! Eventually found the right one.\n",
      "I have fallen in love with Sheraton beds and pillows! By far THE most comfortable bed I have slept in for a long time! (And since!)\n",
      "Room Service was great (although they did get the order wrong the second night; but added free drinks for the mix-up) - it was easier to put the children to sleep and order room service than trekking out to eat.\n",
      "Stayed in LA before for 2 nights and this was by far a better hotel experience; larger room, more comfortable, closer to the airport yet quieter AND has a Starbucks downstairs! This appears to be an updated hotel and it feels like a pretty swanky hotel when you walk in. From start to finish the hotel staff, especially a woman named Diane was extremely helpful. They always tried their best to accommodate my needs and did not hesitate to ask again after they fulfilled my request. I also attended a conference at the Westin, which is considered a higher level brand for this hotel chain, fairly close to this hotel and the customer service was not as great as it was here. I would definitely stay here again for business. I didn't have a car and this hotel isn't located to any restaurants within walking distance, but still a great stay for a conference venue. Great location for convenience to LAX w/ free shuttle, but no free parking (both valet & self-park are $$) and the self-park is actually a separate LAX parking lot behind the hotel for $10/day. Rooms are clean and good size. Easy to work in with a good sized desk & certain rates include free wireless internet. Couldn't get the wired connection in the room to work. Bathrooms are tired, with dirty grout lines in the shower and along the countertop. Bathtub drain was slow. Smallest shampoo/conditioner/soap sizes I have ever seen.\n",
      "Bar stays open late w/ full menu for late night dinners.\n",
      "Very quiet considering the close proximity to the airport. Stayed in mid-April 2012 for seminar being held at the hotel. First off, easy access to free shuttle to and from the airport. No ID/room confirmation needed, as I was told it is a courtesy shuttle. Doesn't look like many people tip the drivers and I understand why. The driver who took me to the hotel didn't get up to help with my bag but it was a short trip, no biggie and that's probably why people don't tip, especially if they load their own bags. Large shuttle, plenty of seats. On the way from the hotel to the airport, the driver did get up and help with my bags, I chose to tip her. \n",
      "Beautiful hotel outside and as you enter the lobby. Very nice decor and lots of places to lounge - I love the plush seating and the chaise lounges. :) I arrived hours before normal check in but thank goodness this hotel will check you in early as rooms become available without an early check in fee (thank you!). I only had to wait 1 hr and 20 min for my room and I loved that there is a Starbucks in the lobby. I enjoyed breakfast and relaxed and later moved to the plush lounging areas to read. \n",
      "My king room was not available when I went to check the status of my room, but they accomodated me with a double queen. Room was neat and clean smelling. Very nice furnishings and the bed and pillows were amazing!!! I'll say more about that later in my review. I decided to order lunch as it was an evening seminar and I ordered from the balanced/healthy menu. It was projected to take 45 min but to my surprise it only took 15 min! :) Nice! FYI, the \"service charge\" or whatever it's called is the gratuity included in the total already. You don't have to worry about tipping but I chose to tip extra because the gentleman who brought my lunch was so helpful and they were so quick. (P.S. I think there was some expectation to tip on top of the tip...I thought I noticed some lingering.) The presentation was nice and they included a glass of water with a slice of lemon since I didn't order any beverages. \n",
      "After lunch and unpacking I took a quick nap. The bed was so comfy! Later that night I had the best sleep I have had in a long time. The bed is not too soft but not rock hard. The pillows are steal-worthy (no, don't worry, I didn't). They were the polyfill (?) and not filled with down which surprised me. The only area that needed help in the room was the bathroom. Upgrade is in order for the bathtub/shower for sure. Oh yeah, the socket under the desk was hanging precariously by wires from my recollection. Other than that, very comfy room. Water bottles available for purchase from your room and coffee/tea station with individually wrapped Starbucks cups for your use. :) I had a great time at this hotel. It is VERY close to the airport but no noise issue from my room on the 6th floor with view of the airport to the left. You can hang out at the hotel before your flight leaves since it's a quick trip to the airport and very comfy. Grab snacks at the gift shop before you go and sign up for the rewards club they have so you can rack up perks for your stay and purchases at the hotel. I will definitely stay again. It's not a 3.5 star hotel in my opinion based on the rating I saw online, but 3 stars sounds right. Once the bathroom upgrades and new touches, I can see the extra 1/2 star added back on. The lobby is definitely 3.5 stars. \n",
      "Sorry, one more thing. It looks like if you head out along the main street, you can find things to do. I didn't explore much as I was only there for a night, but it's worth talking to the concierge for great and economical ideas. I heard there was a $5 shuttle to and from the beach, but I haven't verified that. :) \n",
      "Okay, absolute last thing! If you follow the credit card-less revolution (or cash revolution), your debit card will have a $75 hold on it and your room charges are taken from that and billed to your account. They will slide an room charge summary under your door the morning before you leave for your review before check out. You can check out from your room via the TV, if you choose and agree with the final bill. Have been a regular guest of the Sheraton Gateway LAX for the last 16 years. Juan Gomez at the Club lounge has been there all these years and is such a wonderful host. He always makes me feel welcome and appreciated as a guest. It is so refreshing to see the same person and makes you feel like your special at your home away from home. Agreeing with the other reviews, this hotel is in good condition, very convenient to airport, and courteous staff. I would have given this place 5 stars however the parking was a big issue. If you don't mind paying $30 for valet service then this would be your ideal airport hotel. The other parking option is to park behind the hotel in a parking lot that is not owned by the hotel. It's $13 per day. The parking lot is confusing because there are two lots on both sides when you enter the lot. There is a sign that says Sheraton guests must park on the left but it fills up quickly. I was told by one attendant that I was not allowed to park on the right because that's for the monthly users. However I noticed the next day Sheraton guests were parking on the right side of the lot. When I asked a second attendant they told me I could park on the right. Needless to say it was frustrating. I know it's not the hotel's fault but it's still a hassle. If you're going to stay here and don't mind paying $30 then I would just use the valet. The hotel itself was nice. The room was big and comfortable. The bathroom in a little need of an update but it was functional. There is a shuttle that comes every 8-10 mins or so to take you to the airport and it gets you there quickly. A few things that I was unimpressed over:\n",
      "1. I asked the front desk for a wakeup call at 6am because I had a flight in the morning to catch. I woke up at 6:15 to my back-up alarm because no wakeup call came from the phone. The man at the front desk wrote it down when I requested it at check-in but it was never processed. \n",
      "2. $12.95 for in-room wifi and you can only use it on one device. \n",
      "3. The parking lot behind the hotel fills up fast even though it's huge so you're pretty much stuck with valet parking for the night.\n",
      "4. They said they'd email me my bill instead of slipping it under the door. It has been over a week and I still don't have a copy of the receipt. \n",
      "It's ok if you're just flying out for the night but make sure to set your own alarm! this is where I always stay when I have an early morning flight from LAX. Much better to have a good night's sleep, and avoid dealing with Los Angeles' morning commute madhouse before a flight. This is an excellent hotel, for an airport hotel----clean, well-maintained, quiet rooms and a decent restaurant. It is a better than average Sheraton property, and I would like it even if it weren't at the airport. Great beds. Nice staff. a 2-night stay before taking the international flight from LAX.\n",
      "Overall good consistent quality from Sheraton Group\n",
      "- good facility\n",
      "- good quality of the room design & decoration\n",
      "- comfortable bed\n",
      "- nice free coffee & tea\n",
      "Parking and dinners are a bit pricy; and the first billing is wrong but staff was friendly and corrected quickly\n",
      "Overall expected good quality from Sheraton and good for a quick stay because of its proximity to the LAX airport We stayed at this hotel for 2 days. It was a perfect option for us since L.A was our last stop on our 9 days trip. We drove down from San Francisco and we were glad that we stayed at this hotel which is close to the airport. Although the hotel doesn't offer free parking (and it is not cheap) we could manage since we found parking at the airport parking which is literally behind the hotel--for a relatively lower price. \n",
      "One of the benefits of staying at this hotel was the guided tours that the hotel offers.The hotel has an arrangement with one of the guided bus tour companies,which you can book from the hotel lobby. The tours were a great way to see the city without worrying about the heavy traffic and long distances between the different locations. Also, being a guided tour you have the benefit of learning more about the city and its attractions while you are busy taking pictures and/ or relaxing in your bus seat. \n",
      "One downside to the location is that there is not much to do--in the vicinity of the hotel-- if you want to spend some time walking around or shopping in the evenings. Also, there are not many options when it comes food, if you don't want to use the hotel restaurant--that is if you don't want to drive too far. If you have a car and are comfortable driving around in the L.A traffic, it is not a problem. FIRST, THE GOOD NEWS:\n",
      "-SO close to the airport - 5 minutes on their FREE shuttle.\n",
      "-Bed was very comfy.\n",
      "-Lounge is open til 1:00am which is unusual - website says 2am but they closed at 1 (not-so-great drink prices - see below).\n",
      "-24 hour room service.\n",
      "-close to transit loop (1 block) which takes you to Santa Monica (40 minutes), Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, etc., pretty fast for only $1.\n",
      "-Starbucks in the lobby.\n",
      "-Free wi-fi in the lobby.\n",
      "-In-room wi-fi is reliable and fast (but overpriced - see below).\n",
      "THE BAD NEWS:\n",
      "-Paper-thin walls. I mean THIN. I was kept up most of the night by a crying baby. And it wasn't just because it was a screaming baby. I could have written a transcript of everything said by the frustrated parents as well - Room 1025 if you're wondering.\n",
      "-OVERPRICED in the lounge - $11 a drink (asked for a glass of Shiraz and a Crown Royal with diet coke). It was $25 for 2 drinks with tax and tip. $25! Really, Sheraton? REALLY? \n",
      "-Overpriced internet ($12.95 /day - that will add up).\n",
      "-Slow check-in process. Took over 20 minutes in line before we were served (no really, I timed it). There were only 2 people ahead of us and 2 staff working the counter, btw.\n",
      "-Bathrooms were dated - tub surround tiles were old.\n",
      "-NO IN-ROOM SAFE! (Room 1025).\n",
      "-We arranged for a late check-out but my room card was deactivated at the standard check-out time so I had to go down to the front desk and wait in line to have it reactivated.\n",
      "Overall, I might stay here again for a short stay, just because it is familiar, close to LAX, has comfortable beds, and the lounge is open late. It's a gamble though, with the thin walls. For a longer stay you better have deep pockets if you intend to drink or use the internet here. Reasonably priced hotel close to LAX. Generally clean and well appointed although there were some ominous yellow stains on the base of the toilet which were still there when I checked out 3 days later. What really wound me up was the outrageous overcharging for basic services I would expect to be included as standard. $12.95 per day for in room internet? $1.50 for a 5 second local call? No breakfast, not even continental? $4 delivery charge for the already overpriced room service? What a total rip off. To add insult to injury, in addition to the compulsory 18% gratuity (in the small print) added to my room service bill, the guy who delivered it went out of his way to point out how I could add a tip when signing the bill! I asked if the 18% had already been added which he confirmed and again pointed out where an additional tip could be added. This intimidating bahaviour is unacceptable and I'm sure some people would feel embarrassed into tipping again. On the face of it the hotel is reasonably priced but the shameless nickel and diming would deter me from recommending it or staying there again. It was on the weekend where the hotel was extremely busy. We were on the way to go back to Taipei and our plan had some technical difficulties. We had to stay at the hotel. We waited more than 45 minutes to check in. We could not believe it will take about an hour to go to our room. Finally the young lady waved her hand with smiling said can I help the next person on line please. As soon as we saw that smile face we forgot the wait time. She said welcome to Sheraton gateway, how can I help you. We presented our discounted voucher to her. She knew exactly what to do. She said hi to our little daughter. She quickly checked us in and said if we need anything for our daughter, feel free to contact her. She said her name was Tasmina. While she was in a process she told us about the starbucks, gift shop, and shuttle service. We were so tired. We asked a glass of milk for our daughter. She said she will take care of it. Within 25 minutes we received a glass of milk and two bottles of water. I called a little later to thank her, but I could not able to reach her. We just want to say Thank you Tasmina. It was a pleasant stay at your hotel and thank you for the glass of milk for my daughter. My wife liked your service very much. We didn’t have much time to see your hotel but the hotel lobby seemed very nice. We would like to visit this hotel in the future. As always, had a great meal, perfectly mixed cocktails and outstanding service at the Papparazzi Lounge in the Sheraton Gateway LAX hotel. Mario and Kerri treated our group like rock stars. They never fail to impress. this hotel is quite elegant as it has just undergone a huge\n",
      "renovation.\n",
      "club floor has a nice hors deurve spread as well as a bountiful continental breakfast.\n",
      "located on 9th foor with a view of airport runways.\n",
      "staff is accomodating\n",
      "Italian restaurant serves fresh cuisine...very good\n",
      "walls are thin so you will hear the guest next door if they talk loud I've stayed at many of the properties near LAX. I'm not in love with any of them, so when a corporate rate appeared at the Sheraton that was $100 cheaper than hotels of comparable service levels nearby, I decided to give the Sheraton a try.\n",
      "It ended up being an acceptable experience -- I wish TripAdvisor had 3.5, as I couldn't quite give this hotel a \"very good\" but think it was slightly better than \"average.\" \n",
      "It's still got that feeling of an airport hotel and, overall, wasn't a fabulous or amazing place. However, it delivered a solid, airport hotel experience, and I had no major or deal-breaker complaints about my stay.\n",
      "My room was relatively spacious and pretty well-appointed. Decor was bland, but pleasant enough. The room's plugs needed some work -- a couple of the wall outlets looked pretty old and were so loose stuff just fell out of them when I tried to plug it in! Lighting was fine. The bathroom was OK -- it was in good condition, but the tub was very elevated, so even I (of average height) had my head above the shower head. My television didn't really work so well -- the remote's batteries were dead and the buttons on the TV were stubborn. That was kind of frustrating. It was a flat-screen TV, but in a large armoire; I wish it had just been on a dresser. Most importantly, however, the bed was super-comfortable -- nice linens, great mattress, etc.\n",
      "Public areas of the hotel were fine. Decor is a bit dark, but the place was clean. The fitness center was excellent -- lots of windows, well lit, good equipment, a nice variety of cardio and weights.\n",
      "I didn't go to any of the restaurants, but I did order room service. It came at the expected time and was actually very good; my chicken sandwich was above-average for room service food, with tender chicken and a tasty avocado topping. \n",
      "Service was OK. My check-in was a bit disorganized -- I got asked for my ID a few times, because the clerk couldn't remember where he was in the transaction -- but it was more just him being near the end of a long day than incompetence. He was welcoming. Check-out was a bit slow but also competent and the clerk seemed appreciative of my business. The airport shuttle ran in a timely fashion and had a helpful driver.\n",
      "Overall, it was an acceptable experience, and for the price in comparison to its competitors it was an easy win. I wouldn't come for vacation or expecting much luxury, but for a quick overnight near LAX it did quite well. Have stayed at this hotel twice now. Comfortable beds is a must for me and its close enough to be able to walk to Disney, although there is also a shuttle bus to take you there for a small fee. There's a laundry which comes in handy for those with families and a couple of shops just in case you need something but don't want to go out. The kids loved the fact that they could watch the fireworks display from the hotel windows situated facing Disneyland, there's a great pool and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. There are hotels a little closer to the LAX terminals, but I can’t image any are nicer. Easy check-in, helpful staff (Me: “Can I really walk back to the airport in the morning?” – Answer: “Yes… quite a few flight crews do it.”)\n",
      "I’m an SPG Platinum, and was immediately upgraded to a suite upon arrival. The room is on the fifth floor and faces away from the actual runways (read: quiet). Shula’s Steakhouse is gone, replaced with a similarly priced restaurant. I had the Greek Salad with Scottish Salmon in the bar/lounge and found it to be very good. This hotel has always had very good service on all of my trips here, which have been many. One area that has always been nice is the Club Lounge where at breakfast, Juan takes very good care of everyone. He has been there for a long time and his service has never changed, always excellent. He is a joy to talk with in the morning to hear about what he has been doing as well. The evening staff this past visit has also been very good and attentive. The Sheraton Gateway LAX has been our choice for years when having to overnight at LAX. We tried somewhere else last year and were disappointed so we went back to the Sheraton this year. The rooms are clean and comfortable, exactly when we need for an overnight stay. We were even allowed a late checkout at no extra charge. The staff were outstanding! One in particular - Gabriela who served us drinks by the pool. There were 8 of us and 2 weeks later she even remembered who didn't want salt on the rim of their marguerita. The only complaint would be that you have to pay for wifi in the rooms. (February 2011)\n",
      "The hotel was good for a layover while at LAX. There is a shuttle that takes you to and from the airport. The room looks a bit dated but the sheets were clean. The internet at the hotel was not complimentary and connection was not good. Food was decent but a bit pricey for the quality.\n",
      "I didn't use any of the other facilities offered as I came to LAX pretty late. I would stay again as the location can't be beat for transit through LAX. This is an airport hotel afterall so no sense in trying to compare this to a resort. I stayed at the Sheraton for a 24 hour solo staycation. I loved every minute of it! The gym was clean, airy and stocked with new workout equipment. The rooms were clean and looked exactly as they are pictured on the website.The restaurants were delicious and even better the staff members were kind and offered great suggestions for add-ins, favorites or wine pairings. The only downside was that I specifically booked this hotel for its pool, however, it is closed until early May. It wasn't a big deal as there's plenty to do but I'll definitely book another night once the pool is open again. I've stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX a few times now when I've had to overnight at LAX. It's very convenient to pick up the hotel shuttle from the nightmare that is LAX and land in this oasis. Rooms are decent sized, very comfortable and reasonably well equiped (no minibar though?). In room entertainment is good but internet is not complementary. The hotel has very well equiped gym. A couple of decent restaurants and great breakfast options. It also has a nice lobby bar which is a nice place to hang out with a book and a nice glass of something. \n",
      "My only complaint on this trip is that the nice pool area was closed for maintainance. No advanced notice from the management advising of this. Just a sign on the door apologising for the closure. No good enough management! Guests need to be advised well in advance of the closure of major hotel facilities so that they have the option to book somewhere else.\n",
      "Overall though, the SG LAX is a nice, well run hotel that I would be happy to recommend. I've stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX a few times and always found it to be okay, but was disappointed by my most recent experience.\n",
      "The pool and spa were both out of service (arrived mid-afternoon and had been hoping for a dip!). And, BOTH of the hotel's restaurants (Paparazzi and Brasserie) were closed! Apparently this is normal on Sundays. I can understand perhaps one hotel at a time closing one day per week, but both at the same time?\n",
      "Shockingly, I found the linens in my room to be quite dirty...mutiple spots on sheets and pillowcases....likely from a dirty washing machine? Not sure. Between the eight pillows on the two queen beds in my room, I was able to find two pillows that didn't gross me out.\n",
      "Upsides to this hotel are that it's relatively quiet, even though it looks out onto a runway (planes don't fly directly overhead), and of course the location...quick easy shuttle ride to LAX. That said, there are so many other options near the airport. I will probably shop around in the future. First the good news – the Sheraton Gateway LAX is a very good value. We stayed there in April 2012. The room was clean and comfortable and the bed was good. Our one experience with the restaurants was also positive. The shuttle service is great – I got to the hotel by car, but used the shuttle to get to the terminal to meet my fiancée. I didn’t have to wait more than two minutes to get the shuttle, and we waited no more than five for the shuttle back. The same thing happened when we left. It was seamless. I did have to wait in line about ten minutes at the front desk when I checked into the hotel, but Yesenia was calm and gracious when I finally reached the desk – just what I needed after a long drive. The rest of the hotel service was uniformly good. The bad news here is the parking. I chose the valet parking option (rather than self-parking), and it did not go well. Although valet parking is $28 a day, the room is still a good value even with the added fee. But the service was spotty. On Sunday morning at 10:00 we had to wait 13 minutes to get our car, and the first five minutes were spent trying to get someone to take my claim check. Later that day, I asked for my keys so I could go to the car and retrieve some possessions. When I got to the car, I found it parked near the street, with the door not only unlocked, but actually ajar. I decided right then that I should have taken my chances with self-parking. If it weren’t for these experiences, I’d give the Sheraton Gateway four or five stars instead of three. We were VERY pleasantly surprised at the caliber of this hotel. Was prepared for it to be the typical older hotel near an airport, given the good price we were able to snag. But it just turned out to be an older exterior, very nice lobby, very nice rooms, very good value. \"Upscale\" if you don't mind that word. Beds are extremely comfortable, rooms spacious enough, yes slightly older bathroom fixtures/tile but not a speck of dirt and nicely updated furnishings. Like \"Peabody Traveler\", we stayed there the last night of a trip to LA so that we'd be near the airport, and we'd do it again. Front desk staff was very professional but friendly and made our special request to be on an upper floor facing the runway happen in a heartbeat - my husband loved watching the planes and the runway lights at night. We shopped in the gift shop, used the fitness center (son commented it was hot in there), and ate breakfast buffet in the Brasserie next morning -- not too bad of a price and good food/good selection - well worth not having to find a restaurant. Self-parking lot location was not at all convenient, so we took the bite of paying for valet parking - but not a big deal. Would love to go back during nicer weather to take advantage of the pool. Very nice stay, very nice place. Sheraton Gateway LAX is an amazing venue to work with. Our company uses this venue on a regular basis as it is easy for our clients to reach from the airport (with free airport shuttle) comfortable, with good meeting rooms and great service. Their event staff are some of the best I have had the pleasure of working with. From Luz to Macelino, Roberto, Marco, Agustin, Alfonso, Gabriel, Jose, and Oscar, they all take pride in doing their jobs well, and making sure we (as their clients) have everything we need to take care of our clients and have an amazing event. I always look forward to coming back to the Sheraton and working with their staff.\n",
      "-Annemarie Wright From beginning to end I had a great stay at the Sheraton Gateway. I had a great room on the 14th floor which was suprisingly quiet even though I was close to LAX. Check in was very quick and the restaurant downstairs had a great breakfast buffet and I liked the fact that this hotel wasn't super busy and not too quiet either, it was good setting. Room service was always quick and all the workers were very polite. The shuttle runs non stop so getting a ride to and from the airport is very convenient. The only thing I can agree with some other reviews is that it looks a little outdated in some parts so a minor facelift would be good for that place. Aside from that I would definitely stay here again especially for business! I was in town for a large 3 day meeting. We had a few issues on Sunday getting help with getting the rooms set up to our requirements but must have just been a Sunday thing because all the kinks were worked out by the time I got downstairs on Monday.The meetings went off great. The food and staff were great and well organized. AV was all over it and easy to get in touch with when needed. I loved the decor. Outstanding service.Lives up to the expectation. Special thanks to Tasmina. She made our stay memorable. I will recommend this hotel to my friend and families. Thank you. We stayed here for two nights in April. 2 Adults, 2 Children. We flew in from Sydney and needed a two night stopover until we flew to Cabo San Lucas. This hotel was fine. No complaints. Room was clean, beds were comfortable. Just a standard airport hotel. Airport transport in the orange shuttle was so easy. Check in easy, staff friendly. We took a taxi from the hotel the first night to the Staples Centre to watch an Ice Hockey game (LA Kings). The taxi cost $50 and return around the same. We loved the game it was so much fun. The next morning we caught the Sheraton airport shuttle back to the airport and got on the disneyland express to Disneyland Resort, then walked to Disneyland. We returned that evening by the Disneyland Express from the Disneyland Resort to the airport. Then got on the Sheraton shuttle back to the hotel, again everything flowed so smoothly. If needed an airport hotel again would have no hesitation staying here. Our airline put us up here when our flight was delayed. Nicer than expected from an airport hotel. The restaurant was a nice surprise as the atmosphere was relaxed and the food was good. Free shuttle from LAX was great and the reception staff were happy and helpful. I’ve stayed here before, but it’s been years. I was surprised to see that there haven’t been any renovations, improvements, or updates. It’s still probably the best airport hotel I’ve stayed in, but it’s beginning to show signs of wear and tear around the edges. The pool cabanas, for instance, have great privacy curtains which can be closed, but the locks have all torn lose, so they can’t be closed properly. So if it’s windy (as it was one of the nights we were there) it’ll be useless.\n",
      "The best thing about this hotel is that one can still order food at the bar up until 1 AM. So if your flight lands late, and you get to the hotel at 10pm, like we did, even though the restaurant is closed (which is unfortunate), the bar will still serve food. I don’t understand airport hotels who close their restaurants before 2 AM.\n",
      "The breakfast buffet could be better stocked (they have lox and cream cheese but no bagels, etc). It was overpriced and should be complimentary for every guest room.\n",
      "The shuttle to and from the terminals is frequent and free.\n",
      "Recommended for an early flight to LAX, or a late arrival. But I wouldn’t want to stay here for more than one night at a time. Functional office block style accommodation with depressing decor. Recycled warm stale air in the rooms, subartic in reception (the concierge had a bar heater on). A sign read 'voted best on the Boulevard'. Doesn't say much for the competition. Rooms are average but were clean. Certainly nothing exceptional. the hotel itself is again average. Had dinner at the lounge bar. Food was fine and reasonably priced. Wifi is free at the lobby area but you will have to pay USD12 for 24hrs of wifi in your room. \n",
      "Staff were all helpful and friendly. All in all a good stay. No real complaints. My family and I stayed over the weekend at your beautiful hotel for Spring Break. Upon check in, the Front Desk agent greeted us with a warm welcome. The Valet guys were all friendly and efficient in retrieving our car. Gabby from the Lobby Bar was amazing! She was the epitome of Excellent Guest Service. She made us feel at home. Her outgoing personality and warm touches made our whole stay very refreshing. We will surely stay at this hotel again.\n",
      "We got an upgraded Corner Suite and it was nice seeing the planes take off and land. My kids enjoyed this a lot. The room was very spacious and clean. Darryl Stewart, Director of Sales surprised us with a delicious amenity of cookies and drinks for the kids to enjoy. I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel twice within a matter of weeks. On the first stay we were updated for a little extra to their executive floor which also included some extra food vouchers to use for dinner. The food in the restaurant was very tasty and fresh. We were very pleased.\n",
      "The lobby was very neat and spacious and stylish. The staff was also polite.\n",
      "The hotel has a regular free shuttle to the airport. The rooms were just a little on the old side but they were still well maintained and very well sound proofed. We had breakfast on the executive floor and the food was great, however we enjoyed even more the full breakfast downstairs.\n",
      "We had a pleasant stay and everything was great. The only negative I can think of was the fact that if you want to self park the car you need to park the car behind the hotel and walking back from the parking lot behind the hotel (fully separated from the hotel) feels like a bit unsafe. However, it is a very short walk.\n",
      "We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Stayed her at two different times as I needed a hotel near the airport. Free shuttle which was nice and convenient. Rooms and bathrooms were nice and large. Nice amenities. Free internet in lobby with plenty of computers and printers so easy to use and print boarding passes - you just need to log in with you room number and last name\n",
      "Staff was friendly, food from room service was even good. Didn't hear the planes at all - soundproof to the outside. Walls to other rooms aren't sound proof - at least with the first room I had - very odd as I was standing next to the window I realized I could hear the guy in the next room very clearly on his phone without even trying.\n",
      "Staff was friendly and helpful. Stayed one night. Shutter service was complimentary. Overall, a good place for a night stay. However, serivce from housekeeping was not very nice. The guy who brought us the rollaway bed, left without helping to set up the bed. When asked to do so, he got impatient and was quite rude. Tiny bathroom but adequate. \n",
      "Front desk guy was quite nice to throw in a free breakfast for the 3rd pax. \n",
      "I'll come back if I need a place to sleep to catch my next flight. This was more pleasant than my stay at another property in the LAX area. Long haul from Cuba, wanted a break before heading back to Australia. Free shuttle bus is always just damn nice, late night check-in was a breeze. Courteous and engaging latino at reception, he was responsive to our request for an upgrade. Club Lounge is the only way to go, my mate was captivated by watching the planes take off and landings (no noise). The continental complimentary breakfast was more than adequate (Starbucks coffee), fresh fruit and even boiled eggs. We paid an extra $50. for a 1800 hrs late check out, worth every cent. We were treated to a sort of late afternoon tea in the Club Lounge, stuffed ourselves silly, I'm an expat Yank and forgot how generous Americans can be, you can even buy beer or wine at a very nominal cost during that short period of time. Oh, yeah, the internet was free whilst in the lounge. Downside, the hotel bar was just a bit pricey for our taste, but thats the reason for duty free grog, ice and soft drinks are available on every floor. We will stay again, next year. The hotel has that bland anonymous slightly dated feel that many large hotels have. Despite this the hotel had all that I needed for a night in LA near to LAX. My only beef was that the hotel shuttle is in fact the EasyPark shuttle with a small sign saying Sheraton on it. Whereas the other hotels have clearly identifiable shuttles. This combined with the fact that one sometimes has to be quite assertive in flagging down the shuttle meant that I missed a few before eventually getting to the hotel. Once there I found everything I expected. A large comfortable room with all the usual amenities. Some reviewers commented on airplane noise but I only got some noise from inconsiderate guests in the hallway, something that no hotel can control. The restaurant and bar were fine and the service was all fast and efficient. The gym facilities were of a good standard and appeared to be in good use by other guests. Overall this hotel is a good LAX option, just be careful when looking for the shuttle. We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway in LA, from April 3-April 12/12. I arrived on the 3rd and my husband arrived on the 6th. He took a complimentary shuttle from the airport to the hotel which was very close. \n",
      "Paul Pina assisted me at check in, and was extremely friendly and helpful. He knew I was alone and asked me to call him at the front desk after I entered the room to ensure I was happy. Paul also made sure I received a mini fridge asap just as I requested. \n",
      "I cannot rate the restaurant or the room service as I didn’t use either. \n",
      "Valet parking wasn’t cheap... $28.00 including tax, but the service was definitely worth it.\n",
      "The cleaning staff always did a great job. No complaints!!! I think they changed the sheets daily because they always felt fresh and crisp. EXTREMELY COMFY BEDS!\n",
      "The management were also very friendly and accommodating. I spoke with Joseph on one occasion and he made sure my requests were met. On our last day, I spoke with Arlene Smith. I cannot say enough about this manager. Talking about great customer service skills!!!! OMG she was absolutely incredible. Thank you Arlene!!\n",
      "I visit LA often and have stayed at many hotels in the area. From the minute I entered Sheraton Gateway, until the minute we left, this hotel far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely return and recommend Sheraton Gateway to all my friends, and family. For an airport hotel, this hotel is quite adequate. It does have a musty smell that would probably be improved with new carpet. The club lounge has a variety of breakfast items. The staff (Juan?) there in the morning is quite accommodating. The workout room is better than most. The restaurant is not as good as I would have liked, or as they claim! But it was...adequate! Arrived Los Angeles at 1am from Washington DC, so we checked into the Sheraton just to sleep. The shuttle came to LAX within 10 mintues and dropped us right infront of hotel. The hotel guests infront of us had issues, ugh at 1am, really?? So we waited in line a while, so the two people checking in took 15 minutes with two different front desk people, ugh. \n",
      "The room was perfect, even though you could see the runways, we had no problem with noise. Also, the room darkening curtains were great. We had a wonderful breakfast there also. Very contemporary style hotel.\n",
      "Took shuttle back to airport after a few zzzz then hopped on the shuttle to HERTZ. Big Tip - DO EARLY CHECK IN FOR HERTZ, the night before you arrive on-line. We waited at least an hour to get our reserved car, and the line was worse at 11 am by the time we left!! Just stayed here 1 night, it was walking distance from airport. The hotel doesn't have its own parking so you have to use the paid airport parking lot behind (paid $13? for 24 hours). The room was nice as you would expect, there is a decent pool and hot tub but they are outside and you have to walk past the lobby and bar to get to them which was a bit odd. Eddie Rayas at the front desk went out of his way to help us. Remarkable service! Nice rooms and we got a deal through a third party website. We have stayed here a couple of times the food is pretty good and itsmamnice hotel. There is a free Xbox near the bar and lots of computers to use in the same area. The only thing I didn't like is that the wifi is not free! Can't believe hotels still charge for this.......\n",
      "In room coffee machine made the best cup of coffee (Starbucks) that ive had for a long time. In town the holiday and had to stay for unexpected funeral. Diane Cheeks comes to my rescue rapidly. She followed up to make sure my needs where met. Could not ask for better service. Thank you so much! The hotel is very old looking when you get to the rooms. The decorator had rather odd taste I thought. Lots of wide open space in public areas. Use of the color BLACK was a bit overdone. The lobby and lounge are huge and ULTRA MODERN!!!! \n",
      "Club Room comfortable and well done. The club floor offered everything we needed and wanted, as did the staff! It was a grand experience. The pool area is pretty. The services super! We liked it, but found the modern look to be a bit cold. Like some of the other reviewers, I like the closeness to LAX, and the Paparazzi Restaurant, but I honestly loved the hotel staff and my room. When I checked in Stephan D was very nice and cordial to me, and Mustaff (I think is his name) checked me out. Both employees were very personable and friendly and checking in and checking out were a breeze. They answered all my questions and more. What I absolutely love about my room were the pillows and bedding! The pillows were Heavenly!!! I seriously want to buy these! After a ripping and running thru LAX and waiting at the baggage claim, I just wanted to rest!! I cherish a good night's sleep and I got it. It's a great hotel, with a friendly staff. Thank you! PS...can I have some free pillows? Just kidding! We've stayed here a couple of times as vacationers on the weekends. I thought the weekend rates were reasonable for this level of hotel.\n",
      "Our rooms have been clean, and the entire hotel has been above par.\n",
      "Parking was $13/day for in and out use of the lot behind the hotel.\n",
      "Although the jet noise was occasionally heard, they have done the right job with soundproofing and double glazing, and it was seldom intrusive.\n",
      "The Paparazzi Restaurant was willing and able to modify an entree to meet my wife's dietary needs. And the Starbucks in the lobby satisfied the morning fresh coffee cravings. Typically stay at this location vs others in the LAX airport area primarily due to the hotel staff and flexibility they provide guests that are frequent residents. The hotel restaraunt - Paparazzi is pretty good especially the hospitality provided by Kerri and Mario at the Bar when I am in town. The food is good and and changes to prevent the regulars from getting bored. I really appreciate that since they know we can take our \"per diem\" to other locations. The new Hotel Mgr Group is paying attention! Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel is super close to LAX. The aiport area hotels have probably one of the best free shuttle systems in the US. The convenience to LAX is one of the greatest attributes of this hotel. I am frequently upgraded to a suite. Platinum status is recognized here very well. Platinum guests get free internet and free access to the club lounge. Sheraton Gateway also has a nice gym with a very nice pool. The lobby bar is always packed and has excellent wings. \n",
      "The breakfast buffet the \"brasserie\" restaurant is amazing. I think it's $20 and offers a very wide variety. \n",
      "The rooms are slightly dated, especially the bathrooms. The beds in this hotel are very comfortable and always very clean. I stay here a lot for its convenience to LAX and for the breakfast buffet. Front desk is always very speedy at check in. All rooms have very good curtains and black the room out well for day sleep. I and several of my coworkers stay frequently at the Sheraton Gateway. We are treated so wonderfully by all the staff and management. We enjoy dinner in the Paparazzi Restaraunt several times a week and never tire of the excellent food or fabulous service. Kerri, Mario and Horatio are fantastic consumate professionals in their service of food and drinks. They make being in the Paparazzi like being \"at home\". When at LAX I highly recommend you stay at this great property and try the best restaraunt in the area. Excellent Italian Food in Paparazzi Restaraunt. Stop in to see Kerri, Mario and Horatio in the Paparazzi Bar - where the drinks are excellent and nicely poured. Very nice wine selection. All served with smiling faces. We over-nighted at the Sheraton due to an early flight out of LAX. Our expectations were definitely exceeded right from our arrival. The staff was polite, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The rooms were very well appointed; clean, comfortable and well decorated.\n",
      "We recommend reserving a table at Paparazzi upon check in. Service was good, but dinner even better!\n",
      "Starwood rates this property as a category 3, but you definitely get more value than that!\n",
      "Highly recommend if you're passing through LAX. We stayed at several Sheraton's on this trip and I thought the Gateway was worth a review. The hotel has a shuttle that comes by the terminals about every 20 min. with a very pleasant driver that helps with luggage. The hotel is only 10 min away. Our check-in was quick, friendly,and efficient. We really appreciated this because we had been up since 3am. We were immediately shown to our room on the Club floor. The room was large, quiet and had a view of the airport. We were well looked after in this hotel. There was no in-room safe, in fact none in the other Sheraton's we stayed at. A front desk safe was on offer. This is not at all convienent for overnight travellers. The club lounge breakfast was plentiful and often replenished,but no hot food. In the evening the club offered a snack buffet but no alcohol although it could be purchased. We recommend the Red Trolley Bus trip to the beach. A stop is ust outside the hotel. If you have time please do the hop-on hop-off trip to Manhatton Beach it is great value. We paid a little extra to keep our room for a late check out and the shuttle took us back to the airport. We would definitely stay here again if arriving and departing from LA. The Sheraton Hotels in the USA are nowhere up to the standard we have in Australia, Asia,or the South Pacific. They are sub-standard in a global sense. If you want better try the Westin Hotels. Club facilities require greater focus and the installation of room safes is a must.\n",
      "Thank you. G & J Knox, Brisbane, Australia We had a ball in room 1201... Service was great. Diane Cheeks at the front desk was fabulous and extremly helpful. We love her she treated us like Queens....PRICELESS! This hotel has a very unique look, from the chairs to the wallpaper. I love their style. I was in for a few nights. Normally, at other hotels the check-out process is pretty standard... leave keys at the desk and email folio. But at this Sheraton, they have outstanding customer service, as I stopped by the front desk, Edward Rayas took the time to properly handle my departure experience. He was very attentive and asked me how my stay was and if there was anything else that the Sheraton could do for me before my departure. It truly amazed me that even on my last minute at the hotel, Edward cared enough to provide me with excellent service. The Sheraton is lucky to have an agent like him! Way to go! I will definitely return to the Sheraton LAX because of his service. Also, their dinner restaurant has great food! See ya soon! First time stay at this hotel near the airport. I usually stay at a competing large chain down the road. This place is nicer. The interior seems to have been newly decorated. The furniture is retro hip, with lots of places to sit in the lobby. The bar and restaurant were really busy, and pretty good actually. WiFi was free and pretty reliable. Service was good. Parking was complicated, as the hotel self park lot is not well marked. Keep going straight past the hotel and park behind it for $11 a day, otherwise, prepare to pay valet rates which are more than double that. Bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was standard, these need renovating next. I would definitely stay here again. Also, there is a free shuttle to the airport, which is an easy walk if you don't have too much luggage. The general standard of this hotel is very good and has all you need for a short stay. The room was clean and comfortable but don't expect anything really modern and contemporary. Service and food in the bar was good. Apart from having to pay for WiFi, there's not much to complain about, and despite being very close to the airport, we couldn't hear the planes.\n",
      "If you can get a good price, you can't really go wrong if you stay here. fantastic for LAX. large, clean, modern rooms. huge gym and friendly bar area. \n",
      "transport from the terminals could be better but i don't think thats the hotels fault.\n",
      "speedy check in and out. FANTASTIC beds I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway for a day lay-over in Los Angeles. The bed was very comfortable, the Starbucks Coffee in the lobby kept me happy after a month of not so good coffee in Australia. The italian restaurant was great and the free airport shuttle very efficient. Would definetely stay there again. I booked with United Mileage Plus points and it was totally worth it. The only down side is the Internet costs $13 in your room. It is free in the lobby / bar area. Pros: \n",
      "1. Nice entrance to the facility\n",
      "2. Starbucks in the facility\n",
      "3. Bed was comfortable\n",
      "4. Free shuttle to airport\n",
      "5. Ask hotel for taxi to Venice Beach - worth the experience for dinner\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Next to 2 other major hotels (Marriott)\n",
      "2. No place to walk for meals\n",
      "3. Concerned about bed bugs (room 407). I got bitten twice the night we stayed in the room. I was not bitten before I went to bed that night but woke with two bites (one on my leg and one on my stomach).\n",
      "4. Showerhead was dirty and did not have proper pressure\n",
      "5. The bathtub did not drain properly so if you took a shower you were swimming in the water\n",
      "6. For the $ 150 a night we expected the basics \n",
      "7. Would never stay there again My home was under repairs due to water damage, asbestos abatement and mold remediation, and I thought I was going crazy with all the problems of having to move my family (5 people and a 3 month old baby) to a hotel. The Sheraton Gateway was so accommodating and sympathetic and made my stay a pleasant experience despite the turmoil in my life. MILTON, the front desk manager, checked me in and was so sweet. Since I had to do my office work from the hotel room, they helped me with faxing documents, etc, and even had copier paper delivered to my room when I ran out!\n",
      " In addition to house problems, my dear mother at the age of 84 passed away during our stay. The hotel was so sweet when I told them, and I was so touched when a special lady there named MERLY PICKETT talked with me about extending my stay a few days more. She was very sweet and sympathetic and she had a sympathy card signed by all the front desk staff and delivered to my room!\n",
      " I would recommend this fantastic hotel to anyone that is traveling to Los Angeles. It is convenient near the airport, and a beautiful hotel with great restaurants, lounge, and even has laundry facilities on the 2nd floor. You could not ask for a nicer staff and accommodating people!\n",
      "Thank you again to Merly, Milton and the staff at the Sheraton Gateway!\n",
      "Deborah Ossanlo\n",
      "Culver City, CA This was a perfect airport hotel. The quality of everything was high. The room was quiet. I slept well. Just what I needed for an early morning flight. Beautiful hotel, wonderful and attentive staff. Only problems we had , with the exception of parking, was that the TV wouldn't turn on and it was repaired within 5 min of calling the front desk. The second problem was that the lobby bar was about 60 degrees, very difficult to be comfortable and enjoy a sandwich at that setting. Nice and clean rooms, quiet and very comfortable beds. For such a nice hotel and reasonable prices, (for LAX area) the hotel should be more upfront with their parking charges. Parking is an issue at this hotel. You MUST either use Valet Parking at $28 per day or make arrangements with other parking facilities. This is not made clear when making reservations. Upon our arrival for a 2 day stay we were told about the cost per day and asked for self park. We were advised to use the EZ Park lot behind the hotel. EZ Park does not have any relationship with the hotel. In the hospitality business - this omission is not professional. It was discussed with the sales team and the front desk. There is nothing they can do - it is how the property is set up. Additionally there was mold/mildew on the shower walls. We had pre-booked another trip with this hotel and we are carefully considering whether or not to give this another try. The staff is professional and accommodating. The food is excellent! Any issues we had, the manager and staff were quick to find a solution. Everyone went out of their way to keep us satisfied. We had a very good experience!\n",
      "They are constantly working on improvements! I would recommend this hotel because it is centrally located in LA and, it's close to the airport, Starbucks on location and, very nice gift shop! One more thing....Family and Children friendly. Beautifully maintained hotel with great service. We only stayed the night after a flight and before departing for San Diego, but it was perfect. Beds were comfortable, and the room was fresh, clean, and best of all, quiet! \n",
      "They have a Starbucks right in the lobby for a quick (but good) breakfast, and a restaurant on site for buffet, a la carte, etc. There is also a small pool.\n",
      "The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle, and is within walking distance of car rentals, so perfect as conduit location for more travel.\n",
      "Highly recommend! I stayed in room 848.\n",
      "The good: I was at the end of the corridor which resulted in a quiet stay. THE BED! Wonderful king size with 4 pillows and great bed linens. The room was warmly decorated. I had a nice view out the window of LAX flights coming and going with minimum noise.\n",
      "Starbuck’coffee to brew. Clean room, everything working. Liked that I could turn the room fan on without heat or A/C, which helps me sleep peacefully. Nice pair of chairs. Good makeup application lighting in bathroom. Bathroom toiletries adequate. Although the bathroom was dated, it was well maintained. Friendly/helpful staff.\n",
      "The bad: No magnifying mirror in bathroom. The electric outlet in lamp on desk made plugging in laptop adapter awkward. Shower head low- anybody over 5’9” will have to stoop a little to wash your hair and face. The bathroom door was right in front of toilet and required you to close the door to use it. If you found this review helpful, please click on “Yes.” Thanks. We stayed at this hotel on our last day of our trip. Parking is a bit confusing as you cannot \"unload\" anywhere before parking your car elsewhere. It seemed as though you were forced to get Valet. (I could be wrong). Check-in was quick and easy. Staff seemed friendly.\n",
      "Rooms were clean and large, and the beds were comfortable! Our shuttle to the airport was less than 5 minutes so made it easy to get to the airport for our flights.\n",
      "The food in the hotel was rather expensive, and I actually got food poisening from either the tap-water or peppercorn steak.\n",
      "I would stay here again. We paid about $130 for this location. Well, first they lost my reservation in the system. Unfortunately, as I was traveling, I didn't have any proof that the reservation had been made. However, giving credit where credit is due, the desk manager did come through with the room as booked.\n",
      "However, that's where the good news ends. The room was not up to Sheraton standards. it felt much more like a Four Points room. No mini bar, the coffee machine was one of those single serving machines with only paper cups. The water cups were also plastic. How you can say you're a free hotel when everything is throw away is beyond me.\n",
      "The coffee shop is only open for breakfast and lunch giving someone with no vehicle no choice but to eat in the high end Italian for supper. The food and service was good but very expensive for what it was. \n",
      "When the valet attendants realized we were in a rental that we were returning, there was no offer of help with luggage. In fact, we were pretty much ignored by all staff except for the friendly 'holas' from housekeeping.\n",
      "I would not recommend this hotel. We stayed here for one night prior to our morning flight out of LAX. This hotel has a great airport location being located just a few minutes drive from the LAX terminals. The room was spacious and met all expectations. The front desk person at check-in wasn't the best employee for the hotel to put at the front desk since he wasn't the most personable, but he completed the job of checking people in. As we walked through the hotel, it was very clean and spacious. The pool looked decent, although nothing spectacular. Parking at the hotel would be via valet parking which I thought cost just a little much considering the airport location. Valet parking personnel were friendly though. If needing to stay near the airport again, I would definitely consider staying at the Sheraton Gateway again. Being near the airport, this is the place that many airlines send their \"distressed\" customers to. I know, there was a shuttle bus full of them! Of course, at the front desk, flight crews get precedence, and if you're arriving later in the evening, there can be a lot of waiting around to check-in. The two clerks on duty seemed harried. It explains why my check-in was a less than stellar experience. It doesn't explain why the concierge was short and too busy talking to the other hotel staff to answer a simple question.\n",
      "The rooms are comfortable and quiet. Plenty of room and clean. Everything worked perfectly and I got much needed couple of nights away! I had a good stay here. Nothing was too memorable. It served it's purpose! At check in, we had a bad front desk person. He just looked depressed. The rooms were clean and spacious. The concierge was sweet and pointed us to some exciting night life.\n",
      "Our TV didn't work.\n",
      "The shower was clogging so the water would rise up!\n",
      "I did like that every time we called down to front desk a requested something, we would get a follow up call like 15 minutes later to make sure our needs were met! On a 3 day stay for the Grammys, in the middle of the night pipes burst behind my bathroom wall! Unfortunately the hotel was completely sold out so I had to sleep in a damp humid room. The next morning they upgraded me to a suite and gave me vouchers for breakfast for the remainder of my stay. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The staff at the Brasserie restaurant went out of there way to be accommodating and even managed to find me a bloody mary several hours before the lobby bar opened. Shuttle to the airport is very convenient. We stayed here twice going to and from Fiji based on convenience to LAX, a discounted price, and Trip Advisor reviews (how did we ever manage without them?!). We actually considered staying closer to Santa Monica to do some sightseeing during our layover, but are we ever glad we didn't! \n",
      "Amazing Service:\n",
      "The front desk staff was kind enough to allow us to store a couple of small items (GPS, LA guidebook, and other things we didn't need in Fiji) in a safety deposit box for the 3 weeks between stays (very helpful when you are worried about luggage weight limitations for inter-island flights). When our return flight was cancelled then delayed 17 hours (meaning we would not arrive in LA until 8am), we called the front desk to change our reservation to \"day-use\". Since the hotel was full, they could not guarantee a day-use room would be available, and it was past the cancellation cut-off time (meaning we would be charged for the night), so they granted us a 3pm late check-out to ensure we could get some needed sleep after our 11-hour flight. The bellman put a special tag on my freshly-woven palm frond basket so it wouldn't get crushed in the luggage room. We were also allowed to use the internet and printer at the business center free of charge after check-out. \n",
      "Rooms:\n",
      "Clean, comfortable, and quiet despite proximity to LAX... We had no trouble sleeping during both our nighttime and daytime stays.\n",
      "Location:\n",
      "There is not much in the area other than airport hotels, parking lots, and rental car outlets; however, LA's main freeways are easily accessible, and a public transit hub is close by (a 5 minute walk). We took the Big Blue Bus to Venice Beach and Santa Monica (1 hour each direction for only a buck each way!). \n",
      "Cheap food alternative:\n",
      "Rather than eat at the hotel restaurant, we walked to In 'N Out Burger (15 minutes)... Delicious!\n",
      "Parking Tip:\n",
      "Avoid paying for valet parking by using the airport parking lot behind the hotel on Avion between 96th & 98th (Sheraton guests pay only $10-13 per day with in & out privileges). We ended up staying here twice - once on arrival at our expense and then for two nights on departure at British Airways'. For an airport hotel it is fine - convenient with a quick shuttle bus, comfortable, good staff, good bar and adequate restaurants (the Brasserie is a bit gloomy), there is a reasonable pool, which would have been good if the weather had been fine,\n",
      "Staying here for more than a night or two is a bit like appearing in 'Lost in Translation' with not much to do. There is a shuttle which goes to Manhatten Beach. A local mall Is about three miles. If you want to go downtown you can take the shuttle to LAX and then the Flyaway bus to downtown.\n",
      "For one night as an airport hotel, however, it is very adequate. Although I did find out that your SPG gold privileges do not apply when someone else pays! Service makes up for much. \n",
      "The front desk staff works really hard to make sure that people feel welcomed and well served. The lobby is nice and there is very convenient free shuttle service to LAX. \n",
      "It is clear that this hotel has been around for a while. Although they have kept up with all the changes that Sheraton requires, greater investment is needed to get the hotel to where it should be. For example, the light shade in the room had been torn and would not sit properly on the light. In trying to adjust it, I noticed that several other people had tried to do this and there where many holes in it where others had tried to make it work. This is a small thing, but it points to a lack of care.\n",
      "The rooms seemed clean and the beds were comfortable.\n",
      "I would return because of the service and the access to LAX. I think this could’ve been one of the nearest hotels to LAX, it took us less than 5 minutes by free shuttle from the United terminal (terminal 7). Great location for a layover. Albeit an old hotel, the room was recently renovated, clean and cozy. There’s a Starbucks on the ground floor. One downside was that they didn’t give out free bottled water. By the time we got to the hotel, we expected to get about 5 hours of sleep before our early morning flight. But because the hotel was either understaffed or inefficient, we got into our room more than two hours later and ended up getting only 3 hours of sleep. Part of this was due to the fact that they provided no map to where their off-site parking was which they then proceeded to charge a ridiculous sum for 3 hours of parking. Don't stay at the Sheraton Gateway. Nothing more need be said. We stayed one night at the Sheraton Gateway en route from Auckland to London with our then 9 month old daughter at the end of November 2011.\n",
      "The Shuttle picked us up from the airport without hassle, but check-in took the shine off things. The girl on the desk was pretty abrupt and unfriendly, she had no record of our request for late checkout or for a crib for our daughter, despite me having phoned ahead to arrange both. She acted as though it was a major headache for her to sort them out.\n",
      "The porter who brought our bags and the housemaid who eventually brought the crib were both really friendly and helpful, no complaints there. \n",
      "The room was really nice, clean and recently refurbished. The soundproofing was good, both from the surrounding rooms and from LAX nearby. The bed was HUGE and really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired and had a few minor problems (such as the plug in the sink refusing to seal), but was basically okay. \n",
      "Our room rate came with included internet and breakfast, so I was surprised to be directed to a screen explaining the charges for internet when I went to check my e-mail. When I phoned the front desk they checked my rate and told me to accept and that the charge for internet would then be deducted from my bill. Something I should really have been told at check-in. \n",
      "Similarly, we went down to breakfast to be told that we should have been given vouchers at check-in. When I went to get them it was the same girl as the night before and the same surly attitude, not even so much as a word of apology. The breakfast was fantastic, however, and the serving staff were all friendly and efficient.\n",
      "We would have liked to have made use of the hotel's fantastic pool area, unfortunately the pool was drained down and taped off, no explanation was given as to why.\n",
      "We used the hotel gym which was great and then had lunch in the hotel bar and again the food and the service were excellent, nothing to complain about. \n",
      "One major complaint is that while my wife was walking our daughter around the lobby in her stroller to try to get her to sleep, she was hassled by a guy who had wandered in off the street and was asking people for money. When she told the concierge desk, they called security and had the guy removed, but this sort of thing shouldn't really be happening at all in this sort of hotel.\n",
      "The late checkout we'd arranged meant that we kept the room until 5pm, so I was distincly unimpressed to return to it just after 2pm (the normal checkout time) to find that the key cards no longer worked in the door. When I went tot the front desk to get it sorted out I got a different girl, but the same attitude. Once again, no apology was offered.\n",
      "So, in summary, the Gateway is a nice hotel with great facilities, but it isn't perfect and it is really, really let down by atrocious front of house staff. In case anyone hasn't noticed, there is an arms race in the hotel biz these days. And it's about time. Hotels are all renovating, and innovating. This place though, average. The rooms are clean and fine, but plain. The lobby was nice, but service was seriously lacking. We waited 10 minutes for someone to come help us with our mountain of bags, then gave up and man-handled them ourselves. Check in was quite good, but then I came back to buy some aspririn. You would have thought I had asked for Russian caviar, \"Um you mean you want me to go check to see if we can sell you aspirin??\" \"OK, we have it, but it's $10!\" \"OK, I'll sell it to you, but it will take a while, I have to fill out this invoice and you'll have to sign it.\" I hope I'm not sounding petty, but has no one ever asked for aspirin before? \n",
      "I paid $120 a night each for two rooms. Had I paid the prices that I see are being advertised now, I would have felt very overcharged. If there really are no better LAX hotels, then I suggest there is a business opporunity there. We stayed at the Sheraton gateway hotel for one night due to its convenient location as we had an early flight the next morning. The rooms were comfortable and the sheets were lovely. We ate in the restaurant downstairs, and while most of the meal was great there were screaming children who ruined the dining experience and the salmon was very overcooked. All in all a positive experience. If it's just for a layover or a night, I could have gotten a cheaper alternative. Hotel is decent enough. Rooms are nice. Food in the restaurant is good. Close to airport. I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Los Angeles, CA. I was there for a convention and Estela Estrada was one of the staff assigned to the Ballroom during my stay. She was wonderful and very attentive. We were there for a week and worked late almost each night. She made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Great hotel Great employee! Diane was awesome in addressing my housekeeping needs. Very efficient and quick service. I'm loving my hotel experience here This is by far my favorite LAX hotel. The front desk is quick and friendly. It has a great vibe to it downstairs, and to me, it definitely has the best hotel restaurant hotel in LAX. The Paparazzo. Great service there from Orazio, Mario and Kerri, along with good Southern Italian cooking.\n",
      "The rooms and beds are very confortable, although the bathrooms are definitely in need of some relooking. They also have a lounge on the 15th floor. Lounge service is always good and to me, it's the best one in LAX. Never overcrowded, just right. Nice for breakfast.\n",
      "I love their pool area, it is always heated just right, so one is able to swim, even on cooler days. Very nice heated cabannas. The gym is great, it overlooks the pool area, and is a great size.\n",
      "The bar and sitting area has a nice friendly vibe, with very efficient service from Greg. \n",
      "Good quick valet service, although it doesn't come cheap at 27$ or so. There is a self parking up the street behind the hotel for half the price, although it's not that convenient in my opinion. Punctual 24hr shuttle service, and it's actually close enough to walk over to the terminals if one does not have much baggage. This hotel is 5 minutes from LAX but very quiet. Beds are comfortable and room is clean. Hallways could use a little updating but the lobby was very nice. There is an internet cafe with complimentary computers, internet and Wi-Fi in the lobby. But you have to pay for in room Wi-Fi. The shuttle is fast and so was check-in. All in all good airport hotel. Very nice facility good location to avoid car rental needs.\n",
      "Great room and very accomodating facility all together. After picking my fiance up from LAX late at night, we decided to book a room here instead of driving back home 4 hours away. The room was very nice, spacious, and had all the amenities we needed. Bed was comfortable and no issues with anything in the room. We valet parked and it was $30, so be prepared for that. Went downstairs to the Papparazzi restaurant and it was so-so, not really the superb Italian food they make it out to be, but still not bad. Overall, it was a great place to stay and the proximity to LAX is really convenient. We were in and out after exiting the terminal in a matter of 5 minutes. After a not so pleasant flight into Los Angeles, I was fortunate enough to be greeted by Diane Cheek at the Sheraton. She had a great smile, and actually greeted my husband and me as though she was genuinely happy that we were there. She was accommodating, and made us happy that we had chosen the Sheraton Gateway for our stay. Thank you Ms. Cheek. I was not sure what to expect. But, I LOVED this place. Our room was comfortable, beautiful and charming; I did not want to leave. The hotel staff was very kind and attentive and provided excellent service. We got there at 8pm, and decided to have dinner at the restaurant. Let me say that dinner was excellent, the waiter was more than amazing. But the best part was the restaurant manager (roman), he made sure my wife and I were taken care. He checked up on us twice during our stay to make sure we were taken care of. We are definitely going back. Nice hotel, very comfy bed, a bit of noise from planes, but we expected that been next to the runway. Nice modern hotel.\n",
      "However BE AWARE everything costs extra: wifi, parking, breakfast, bottled water. Make sure you check first to see if it is included with the room. \n",
      "I asked the waitress 3 times if breakfast was complementary and she said yes, we had our buffet breakfast then got presented with a $45 bill. I don't think so. I had them reverse this as the waitress said it was free. \n",
      "Would not stay here again, even though i liked the room and hotel, i don't like the fact that you get charged for everything extra and the staff were not that friendly either. I have visited the Sheraton Gateway LAX over two dozen nights a year for the past several years. The rooms are generally average and the location, on Century Boulevard, is very convenient to anyone requiring access to the LAX airport. This present trip, however, has demonstrated to me how far the standards at this hotel have dropped. I was given a room with a broken tv which could not be fixed which meant that I had to pack my belongings again and move to another room (with no help offered by the hotel). I was then given a room which was subsequently assigned to another guest. While I was sitting, partially unclothed, at the workdesk another customer opened the door with a magnetic key and entered the room! It seems they had given the same room to two people. When I contacted the front desk the manager on duty told me how embarassed he had been when he realized that two people had been assigned to the same room. Why he did not call the room when he realized this mistake remains a mystery. I waited in the lobby with all of my luggage over 30 minutes to be given a new room. I have asked to discuss this security breach with the General Manager of this property but he has been unresponsive.\n",
      "I am attaching a few photos of the room I was given to help demonstrate the failing standards of this property. We stayed at the Sheraton because of it's close proximity to LAX. Check in was smooth, our room was on the 5th floor and hardly any noise from the planes more from other guests slamming room doors. And the rooms were not as sound proof from the neighboring room as we'd like. Could hear our neighbors toilet flush, shower and talking from the TV. Our room however was well appointed, clean and comfortable. I checked into the Gateway Sheraton hotel after being in several , Horrible hotels in the LAX area.......once I arrived , I was Greeted very warmly and checked into my room quickly. I had several questions about restaurants and other fun things to do in the area and called on the operator Dianne or help. I could not have asked for a warmer and kinder person. She was informative and made my stay here at the hotel very Special! If you ever check into the hotel , ask for Dianne , she will make your stay feel like Home!!! we arrived here after a long flight and we were really shocked by the room decoration. everything was either black or dark brown. it just made it look like a graveyard.\n",
      "we tried the restaurant and had lasagne. it had nothing to do with an italian lasagne. was more like a chilli concarne ;-)\n",
      "the hotel has a free shuttle to the airport which is stopping at several other hotels so it can take a bit. i forgot my jacket in the shuttle and i called 30 mins after arriving at the airport. they couldn't find it anymore. i was the last passenger in the bus. you can imagine the rest. We had read great ratings about this hotel and weren't disappointed with the hotel's appearance in general, but they could do much better. Right from check-in (we stayed there 3 nights; at the beginning and end of our trip to the LA area) we found the desk staff to be aloof and uncaring. We did get the kind of room we requested and they will tell you which is the quiet side and which isn't; beware of the constant noise of the jets if you stay on the street side. The other side of the hallway is much better and the view of the city skyline and Hollywood Hills is nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the cleaning ladies were friendly and accommodating. The hotel doesn't offer free in-room Wi-Fi and the business center is small and crowded. We discovered a leak in the hallway near our room (water was literally pouring out from a ceiling light fixture), reported it to a disinterested clerk and the next day it was still dripping and the carpeting was saturated. We went to the lobby and reported it to concierge instead and within a half hour spotted maintenance attempting to find the source and fix it. But overnight the damage had been done and they had to cordon off that area. Made us wonder what other things get neglected. Oh, we know. The desk chair and occasional chairs in the rooms were filthy, the light switches in the bathrooms had enough grunge on them to appear never cleaned and there was mildew all over the caulking in the sink area. It's never pleasant to be washing up with black yuck facing you. The tiles in the tub area were old and needed to be replaced as well. Then there was the hand-held hair dryer that wasn't attached to the wall. It had sticky, dirty stuff all over it and was disgusting; really, Sheraton? For the price paid, we expected better. In addition, the restaurants were very expensive, free breakfast was not offered and the only cheaper option was Starbucks. We did appreciate getting a $5 giftcard there when we opted out of room service for the day. Eco-friendly hotels are a plus. We did like the ease of getting to and from Hertz via shuttle and the valet parking. It was expensive, but the service was fabulous; great employees out there. Wish the concierge and desk staff were more like them. Overall, a mixed bag kind of stay. Efficient easy check-in, dropped off our rental car at Hertz who have a great complimentary driver to take you back to your hotel. Very comfy room with a pretty skyline view. Recently renovated so fresh and new. Very good late meal in the Bistro with good service. Very comfortable bed and pillows, so we had a great night's sleep to prepare for our return trip to Australia. Checked out easily next morning and the hotel kept our bags and suggested we catch the trolley to Manhattan Beach for the day, (our flight not until later that night) which stops very near the hotel. Drop off and pick up for a couple of shopping centres as well, just a great way to spend a day in LA. The airport shuttle arrived immediately on our return and we were on our way feeling relaxed and ready for the trip. This is a great airport hotel, charming friendly and helpful staff. Everything works well. Great hotel, comfy beds, well appointed room and lovely and clean throughout. Definitely the best night's sleep I had in my recent trip to LA.\n",
      "The staff are universally lovely and friendly. Got genuine \"Hi's\", \"Hello's\" and warm smiles from the ladies cleaning the rooms, had funny chats with bar staff (one of whom gamely took an impromptu 30 second dance lesson!), and had brilliant service from front desk.\n",
      "A special mention must go to all the restaurant staff especially Miguel who were charming, friendly and super helpful.\n",
      "All the food in the hotel was good. BTW whoever cooked the seared Tuna steak I ate on Saturday was a genius... You have to try that! This is an older property located just blocks from the airport and car rental lots. Large lobby area and bar. Rooms are pretty standard to the Sheraton brand, comfortable, medium size. \n",
      "Issues on this stay:\n",
      "-The AC unit is quite loud, enough to wake me up periodically when it turned on throughout the night. \n",
      "-Used room service plates and dinnerware littered in the hallway for hours before anyone attended to them. \n",
      "-Very limited front desk staff in the morning (check outs, copy of folio, etc). Unusual since this is a business traveler-oriented property with many flying out early. \n",
      "-Emergency exit sign by our room was broken and dangled in the hallway during the entire stay, low enough for a 6'0 person to have to duck under. No one bothered to fix this during the stay .\n",
      "None of these issues are huge, and it was NOT a terrible stay, but to display a Sheraton brand on this dated place and charge ~$100/night, travelers should highly considered one of the many other hotels in the area. As a reference, this hotel does not offer complimentary WiFi, parking or breakfast (none of the above), where others do offer some/all, at a lower nights stay. \n",
      "Travel tip: Street parking behind the Sheraton is available. Most spots are 2-hour zones patrolled through 8pm or 12-midnight every day of the week. Otherwise, self-park for ~14 is available, or Valet. Sheraton Gateway is a fantastic stopover whether traveling to or through Los Angeles. The rooms are heavenly, Club level gym, resort style pool for great relaxing. Meeting rooms and business support is 5 star. The best breakfast buffet in the nation. Lots of professional and friendly staff to ensure you have a great stay! I've stayed here for business many times, and just brought my wife here for a vacation stopover. You can't go wrong here! I was in Los Angeles for 29 hours before coming back to Vancouver\n",
      "I want to spend some time in Santa monica and get back to the airports and this hotel was just perfect the room a bit small but all what we need, the Service was exceptional very nice staff easy to deal with ... the lobby is large and functional a large office work place available Swimming pool open till midnight a starbuck and convenient shop 2 restaurants I try the Paparazzi not bad but very 70's, old school, heavy food, not very refine but great service.\n",
      "I fund a use underwear on the floor when I lift the bed cover I was shock but thinks happen I grab then with the hotel pen and shoved them in the ice bucket plastic bag and bring them to the clerk at check out she was genuinely mortified apologies and I told her outside of this incident everything was great she save the internet connection from my bill $12.95 this was unexpected and welcome. I check out at 9.30 AM, leave my 3 bags with the bell boy to spend time in Santa Monica and Culver CIty for some shopping back at 5 PM, As this is glue on LAX airport they are very organize to accommodated there guests waiting for a late flight large lobby with very comfortable chairs and couch tele and very large outside area with swimming pool and cabanas.\n",
      "Over hall very good place to stay for a day or two waiting for your flight But if you are sensitive to noise you are glue on LAX Airport and flight till 1.30AM and start again at 6 AM Personally I like the sound Stayed one night. It was very close to the airport but I didn't hear the planes. Stayed at the fifth floor. Airport shuttle was fast. It runs on a continuous loop so the timing may be between 15 to 30 mins. Arrived late and check in was smooth. Starbucks at the lobby was closed by then. Room service delivery was 30 min. Came with a bread basket and water. No free wifi. Had $3 bottles of water in the room. There were a variety of HD channels. Asked for an express checkout the next day. Receipt was slipped underneath the door and just had to drop off the room card. Diane Cheek gave excellent service - very polite, professional and friendly. Hope she hears from you about this review. We stayed at this hotel this last month for a family weekend getaway. We knew staying near the airport could be noisy but requested a room on the runway side anyway so the kids could watch the planes take off and land. The noise level was minimal- I've stayed at downtown hotels before and I find traffic noise worse than runway sounds. The airport provided great entertainment for the kids as they spent alot of time watching the runway activity out the room window. The beds were very comfortable and the room was fine. My biggest complaint was the breakfast served in the restaurant. They have a breakfast buffet which was about $20 per person so for a family of four this was pricey (should have gone to Starbucks in the lobby but family wanted a sit down experience). I don't mind paying high prices if the food is good but this was the worst breakfast buffet I have ever seen. The scrambled eggs can only be described as \"eggs soup\", the pastries were stale, the waffles were hard and crunchy, and I can't even explain the texture and flavor of the pancakes. My daughter said they \"must be the healthy pancakes\" but when I checked they did not appear to be the multi-grain pancakes that you find at other places and they definately did not have the texture. In contrast to the awful buffett the service was excellent. The pool is heated which is a plus because it was cold out yet the kids were able to swim. We booked A day room here whilst we where waiting for our onward flight home. Service was really great, helpful and friendly.\n",
      "There is a free shuttle service to and from the hotel to the airport which is only 2 mins away.\n",
      "One fault- As this was a day room it's normal that people use it to sleep and freshen up after long flights so as we wanted to sleep after a 13 hour flight, we put the do not disturb on the door, however this didn't seem to stop the service staff knocking and shouting to let her in and trying the door twice during our stay. \n",
      "However I forgot my plug adapter so I called front desk and there was one up within an hour.\n",
      "Overall nice, clean hotel with a lovely pool and gym and Starbucks. If I was in LA I would defo stay here again. Despite having a fully pre paid booking, the staff were not helpful at all. After a long flight from Australia I requested an early check in. The staff said there was a room available but there would be a Full nights charge even though the check in was only a few hours early. I also requested a place to wait and was told there was no where at all. If there is availibility I cannot see the problem with allowing the guest into the room, not good customer service and certainly not good PR for The Sheraton name.\n",
      "In all very disappointed. Many aspects about this hotel (physical quality of room, exercise room, swimming pool) are perfectly find -- just what you'd expect from a 3.5* airport hotel. However, even though many of the employees act friendly and professional, the service is very spotty. Examples:\n",
      "- Double charged for two different items: At the hotel restaurant \"Paparazzi\", the prices for items on the bill were higher than on the menu. I was also double charged for internet access.\n",
      "- $20 was stolen from my room. This is not entirely the hotel's fault, but it shows that they may not be adequately supervising their housekeepers.\n",
      "There is a Starbucks so breakfast is fine. I was there for a couple of nights and chose the hotel cause it was close to the airport, only 15 mins drive from downtown with a very reasonable price for the type of hotel. When we arrived we realized we were too tired for going out and the hotel had everything we needed. there is an italian restaurant that looked inviting, but being italians we decided not to go there (we have plenty of italian food at home!). so we decided to go at the bar which served us an excellent salad and a grilled salmon. In the morning you can have a classic \"tall cappuccino\" and a muffin at starbucks, or go to the Brasserie (very delicious). Also the room service looks good, didn't use it eventually, but seems like it has a bit of everything at good prices as well. I would definitely recommend it!! By using the Matching Price web site offered by Sheraton, they will match what ever web rate you are able to find. Ours was $89 per night. 35 years in hospitality, many of the front desk staffers are among the best that I have experienced. Great smiles, helpful, friendly, professional. Had a bit of a glitch with the matching rate upon arrival, but once we escalated, the rate was fixed. Slight problem with guest room cleanliness and missing amenities (towels, cream rinse, coffee service shy on supplies). Irritating, but fixed with a phone call or by catching a housekeeper. While waiting for a Christmas holiday flight and getting bumped nightly, we checked in and out daily for five nights. We saw the good, the bad and the ugly. I caught the shuttle and was in my room in 20 minutes....This hotel is one of the most convenient airport hotels.....It is clean and has a small pool for those who use. It is right by the car rental lots so that is also very convenient if you arrive late and want to start your rental the next day and save some $$. Beds are the Sheraton sleepers which are very comfortable. They have a lounge but I didn't use it this time around. Would I stay here again....YES....For an airport hotel, it doesn't get much better! Cheers! NYC for an airport layover. It is very close to LAX and the shuttle bus ran on time. On the downside the front desk personnel was less than helpful and the lobby and corridors were dirty and uninviting. We did not get the room type requested in spite SPG membership and booking directly with the hotel. However, our room was clean and had a comfortable bed. Airport noise was minimal. All in all the hotel worked well for our purpose. Stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles for three hours as we waited for our connecting flight to Australia. The hotel is probably one, if not the closest hotel to LAX. The two queen bedded room we had was very clean. It had a flat screen tv. My only recommendation is you park at the garage parking right next to the hotel. We decided to valet park our car and we were charge the full day rate of around $26. As we exited, we saw the $10 daily rate next door. But other than that, I would highly recommend the place especially if you need to be near the airport. Room was clean and comfortable.\n",
      "Great location. Shuttle to airport runs every 15-20 minutes.\n",
      "But water for bath was too cold! The hottest water was approximate 40°C only! Water from tap was even hotter.\n",
      "Overall, a nice hotel. I wanted to commend a particular wait staff person, Estele Estrada, who was exceptional in her service. I was at a very large meeting with hundreds of my colleagues and you don't expect much in the way of service at these large meetings, however, I was pleasantly surprised with Estele. We had a buffet breakfast and lunch laid out for the participants each day, however, I had specific requests regarding my meals. Not only did Estele accommodate me the first day, she remembered my requests and provided them to me everyday I was at the functions with a smile. Estele was always friendly and courteous. WOW! I was so impressed that she would remember my dietary requests and had them at the table when I sat down. Now that's service!!\n",
      "Estele is the standard that other wait staff should be measured by. What exceptional service! Thanks to you, my stay was immeasurably more pleasurable, albeit a working meeting. Please make sure Estele Estrada is recognized. Good service should be rewarded! Better than average for an airport hotel, and good value provided you get your breakfast as part of your room rate. Location precludes a choice in dining, so you have few, if any, options. Shuttle service is especially handy. Service people were friendly, and quite helpful with heavy bags and such. I needed to stop for the night at LAX this Christmas Day and chose the Sheraton Gateway LAX for my stay. I got a great rate on the Starwood web site. \n",
      "Arriving into LAX I got the hotel shuttle - you do have to be slightly patient for these to arrive but its a good service. \n",
      "Check in was easy and quick. My room was available and looked out over the two north runways at LAX. There was a bit of noise when aircraft took off, but it did not disturb my sleep at all.\n",
      "I went downstairs for dinner in the evening to find the main restaurant closed but the lobby bar open and serving a brasserie style menu. It was quite busy at the bar and most tables were occupied. The staff were literally running around to keep up but despite this they remained smiling and chatty - I was very impressed by this. My meal was very tasty and good value too.\n",
      "After dinner I had a nice relaxing bath and then fell into a deep sleep in the lovely bed.\n",
      "The room was perfectly adequate, in fact more than that it was very spacious and comfortable. Shame there were several reminders of previous guests in the form of peanuts scatered around on the floor in odd places!!!\n",
      "The next morning I ventured downstairs for breakfast. The main restaurant was now open and a full breakfast buffet was on offer. It was not as attractive as some that I have experienced at Sheraton properties, but none the less was more than adequate. Again staff were friendly and welcoming. It was not that busy.\n",
      "Went and packed for my onward trip.\n",
      "Check out was easy and efficient whilst remaining friendly - nice touch.\n",
      "Christmas is always a tricky time to stay at a hotel but thanks to all the staff at this Sheraton property who put in the extra effort to make it an enjoyable experience. We arrived at 7am from LAX and predictably the room wasn't ready and fair enough, we decided to accept their offer of an upgraded room for $50 a night more (for three nights). The hotel is fair enough; good rooms, great TV, nice ambience and quiet but the concierge service is not good. We were quoted $120 for two people to go to Getty on a tour bus leaving that day as the only way to get to Getty and instead decided to catch the bus. The buses go up Sepulveda Blvd and cost us $4 for two and they start right across the road. We were disappointed that the full range of options was not given to us since we made a saving of $116 by not taking his advice. \n",
      "The food is ok and they do have a nice restaurant. A good transit hotel but I would stay somewhere more central for an LA visit. That said, it was probably easy to go to the airport to go home wherever you are in LA and then it is a 3 minute shuttle (free) back to the hotel. So... you can take your choice over this one. This hotel had an exceptional location so close to LAX airport. We used it as a transit hotel between flights . Had to wait only 15 minutes for the courtesy shuttle which runs all day and night. Felt that the service lacked in all areas of the hotel. Really just a hotel that is very busy and not as concerned with an individual person.\n",
      "The bar was very slow on service, and we had to keep hunting staff down to get our needs met. I am going to rate my stay at this hotel only on the day of the incident which was January 01, 2012. I always booked my stay thru www.SPG.com a month in advance, so what happened to me should not happen to any guest. I arrived at the hotel at about 9:30 p.m. The counter only had one customer service agent taking care of the flight crew, Platinum & Gold line, and the regular line for everyone else. \n",
      "There is always an excuse for everything ………..we are busy………..short of staff………and it goes on and on…..\n",
      "Anyway, after finally getting my room key, I proceeded to my room and went to sleep. The next morning as day light illuminated my room, I noticed that the two loveseats in my room were filled with dog hair. As an asthmatic person I was so irate that I called guest services and requested a manager to my room. Director House Keeping Maximina Gachuzo came inside the room and to her surprise I wasn’t exaggerating and making it up. The only remedy that this lady afforded me was 2000 points into my spg account which I declined. I asked her if dogs were allowed to stay inside the rooms at this hotel and her response was yes. I also told her that it’s not hard to have a list of rooms with pets so that these rooms can be properly cleaned afterwards. With a simple vacuuming to recycle these rooms for other guest is not enough. Dog hair is a trigger for some asthmatic individuals that can lead to a chronic inflammatory of the airways, which then leads to an asthma attack.\n",
      "Any excuse that this hotel gives me is unacceptable since management is well aware that hotel rooms are public shared places which should be sanitized and clean properly after guest check out. \n",
      "If you travel to this hotel with family members that are asthmatic, please check the rooms when you go inside. I mean, check everything from furniture to bed sheets. \n",
      "Director Gachuzo only took action when I pointed out the problem, other than that the cleaning personnel are not being supervised properly. We stayed at the hotel for one night between the long flights - rooms are very comfortable and cozy. Dinner at restaurant was very good. Highly recommend for transit passengers! Close to Lax. Newer Sheraton model. Updated rooms and solid service. I was fortunate to have this hotel booked for me after finishing a tour around the West coast to rest and recouperate before returning home. The hotel was busy but clean and efficeint on check in with the concierge staff being extremely helpful to orientate me to various locations in the area. My room was on 11th floor and had a fabulous view of the airport runway, which is busy all night long (so if you sleep lightly - please note this might not be the best location). I was able to get free wifi in the lobby and had access to their lobby computers to check in online and print off my boarding pass at no extra cost. The hotel was ideally located with a 5 min shuttle ride to the terminal and also conveniently located 5 min walk from the bus station at the rear of the property where you can catch the bus to pretty much anywhere in LA. I was keen to do my Christmas shopping so caught the number 6 to Culver cIty Westfield Mall for $1. Room Service was expensive and the food was mediocre but had to call Guest Services twice for a variety of matters in the room and on both occassions the service was ultra efficient and helpful. The room was huge and suited me fine with the most amazing king size sweet sleeper bed which was a godsend after my variety of budget lodgings I had frequented for the previous 2 weeks. To eat around the area, head to Westchester Parkway area and theres an In and out, IHop, Ralphs Supermarket, CVS and various smaller eateries to visit - its approx a 2 min bus ride or a good 20 min walk. Overall a lovely hotel and would recommend this to anyone looking for a luxurious stay for a 1-2 night break close to the airport. We had two stays at this hotel in December, both were ok my me, reception was helpful both times.\n",
      "Both times we ate at the tables at the bar, service there was good and the staff friendly. The food was good also. The bar area is a high open space and felt cold. (so consider taking a light jacket just in case).\n",
      "Starbucks cafe in the foyer if you want wait for a coffee.\n",
      "The hotel rooms are getting old and need bit of a refurbish as the fixtures have seen better days. \n",
      "Found the bed comfortable and slept really well.\n",
      "It is a popular place for the airlines crews, so be considerate of them as you move about the hallways especially if you see 'please do not disturb' signs. (nothing worse than a grumpy, sleep deprived hostie on you next flight).\n",
      "The wifi internet was free with the room, although you had to logon and agree as if you are going to have to pay. (you need you room number and last name to login). Convenient pickup w/complimentary shuttle. Shuttle can get crowded. Radisson shares the shuttle. \n",
      "Easy check-in w/a dedicated SPG member area. Upgraded to a nice suite as a Platinum member. Suite was large and comfortable, quiet. Usual Sheraton bath amenities. 3 free bottle of water in the room.\n",
      "Lounge was closed when we arrived (11PM). Apparently it serves evening drinks and snacks. Continental breakfast is served in the lounge, with pastries, bagels, cereals, oatmeal, fruit, and hard-boiled eggs. Bagels were not very fresh and oatmeal was runny.\n",
      "Service is friendly and helpful. Had drinks and appetizers in the bar/restaurant. Service was less than attentive. We had to flag the waiter down to place our food order and get the bill. Food and drinks were overpriced (not too unusual for this type of hotel)\n",
      "Convenient shuttle back to the airport. Only had to wait about 10 min. Per the FD, shuttle run every 15-20 min. The shuttle can get very crowded.\n",
      " Overall, good stay, convenient to the airport. We booked this in advance as we were arriving early from Tahiti and had 12 hours till our transatlantic flight to London. Room clean, nicely decorated and tea and coffee provided. Bed super comfy and we slept soundly for 5 hours! Despite being right on the airport no noise at all. Lighting poor but this is now common in hotels due to energy-saving lights but nevertheless I find it very irritating. As this was only a day stay we did not use bar or restaurant but we found the receptionists very friendly. We had a short stay here in December. The lobby was decorated for the Holiday and it looked great. In front of the hotel had a warm feeling with two large torch lighting up during night. The room was nicely renovated and decorated with black, red, and gray color. However the bathroom had 2 star hotel feeling to it. The vanity was old the bath tub was painted over and some paints were chipping. It had a nice shower with a lots of pressure but, the old drain could not keep up with the draining and water pooled up deep when I was taking shower. The most disappointed things were customer service and airport shuttle service. The hotel shares some vans with other hotels near by to pick passengers up from LAX which is about 5 minutes away. Those van are making continuing loop between hotels and LAX. Hotel post that there are pickups every 15-20minutes. We were waiting at the LAX pickup points for a long time when we called the hotel. The front desk connected us to a lady at valet who really did not care. She said that the van is at hotel now and leaving soon to the LAX and it will be 15-20 more minutes before our pickup. First, it only takes 5minutes to the LAX, well OK it might have to make few different terminal stops but, do they only have one van? We end up taking a van for a long term parking located near the hotel since the driver offered to drop us off by the hotel. When we mentioned about the shuttle service at the front desk, the clerk did not care and brushed us off. Later we hound out that the van service was contracted out to a third company. The hotel appearance was nice, room was good, bathroom was not even close to the Sheraton standard, and service was shameful. Several days ago I booked and paid (in advance and in full) for my hotel stay at the Sheraton Gateway in Los Angeles. It was the first time that I would be staying at a Sheraton as I am a Marriott loyalist and I was looking forward to the change. \n",
      "But to my surprise, I would be in for a not-so-pleasant treat. \n",
      "The check-in agent did not at any time say good evening or welcome to the Sheraton. I had just been slapped with a $20 cab fare by a man who could barely speak English (for an $11.35 meter reading at that). So I was already flustered from the taxi cab (where have all of the American taxi drivers gone?). \n",
      "Then I was told while checking in at 1:00am that although I had already paid for my room in advance, in full, several days ago, allowing Sheraton to make interest on my money before I would get to their hotel, I would still need to fork over $75 for one night in the event I incurred any incidental charges. I told the lady that I would be checking out in less than 10 hours to connect with my flight to Las Vegas; her reply: \"I cannot check you in unless I can get the $75.\"\n",
      "As an AAdvantage Platinum traveler (travel in excess of 50,000 miles per year), I would advise all persons to avoid this hotel. I waited in line while a couple stopped by to get a key re-activated to be told that their room (with all of their belongings in it) had been assigned to someone else. Can you imagine? We stayed here for our last night in the US. The bed was super comfy, and the rooms were impeccably clean. There was a great amount of freebies in the bathroom- we were impressed with how many! We were able to get a late checkout at a minimal cost. We arrived late and were disappointed that it was too late to eat in the restaurant, however the service at the bar was really great. I'd definitely stay here again if I needed to stay close to LAX. Only one negative thing- allow a long time to get your car out of the carpark. There was only one person working on the paystation, so it was a long wait to leave. I had read the reviews and expected a bit \"extra\" at what is basically just a slightly better than typical Sheraton. The front desk was indeed professional and prompt. My room was nicely outfitted but surprisingly compact. The bathroom was nice buy small. This being a Sheraton, all \"extras\" are charged additionally, although I believe guests get four \"complimentary\" toilet flushes (irony here). The valet parking is silly expensive..this is an airport hotel and the large half-empty lot is right in front of the Hotel. Apparently there is merely \"expensive\" self-parking but I was not offered this. As with most Sheratons this place is not torture, merely very poor value for money. Options may be limited right at LAX (I was meeting someone arriving late at night and had little flexibility), but LA is a big place, Those not needing to be right at the airport seek something better. My husband and I stayed at the gateway for one night after traveling for approximately 24 hours. We decided to have a stop over somewhere near the airport before picking up our rental car to begin our trip the next day. The hotel shuttle picks up from the airport approximately every 15 minutes and the driver was very friendly and helpful. The check- in process was fast and efficient although it was busy when we checked in and so therefore had to wait a little. The room was clean, not flash, but more than adequate for our needs. To try to combat jetlag we used the gym facilities which were excellent. The package we booked included breakfast and free wifi which was well worth it. The breakfast selection had a good assortment of hot and cold items including cereal, pancakes, eggs and cold meats. The service in the restaurant was excellent. I would recommend the hotel for short term stays but be aware in some rooms (ours for example) you can hear the planes although the noise didn't bother us. I think it was great value. The staff are exceptional. Everyone we dealt with had a smile and a kind greeting. The location is good, close to LAX with frequent shuttle service. The room was clean and the beds are incredibly comfortable. We frequently stay at Sheraton hotels, and this is definitely one of the better ones. I'm a big fan of this hotel, esp. when I need to be near LAX to catch an early flight. \n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Shuttle to LAX every 15 minutes (5-7 minutes to terminal)\n",
      "-Generally very friendly staff\n",
      "-Great success with SPG plat upgrades (club rooms are very large... love the airport view... not as loud as you'd think!)\n",
      "-Nice SPG lounge with hot breakfast & evening snacks...drinks available all day...great view of the runway... love to watch the planes coming in and taking off!\n",
      "-Nice gym with pool / hot tub right outside\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Personally (purely a preference thing) but I find Sheraton pillows to be way too soft\n",
      "That's really the only \"con\" I can think of; like I said, this a great hotel located right near LAX. Highly recommended! We met up with friends who were on their way to a cruise and I had suggested the Sheraton Gateway. We were so impressed with the friendliness of the staff upon check-in and when we saw the room, we thought we had bagged an upgrade,,,,,,,,,but not so! The room was spacious, the bathroom was lovely and the linens were exceptional. This was the standard room at this property.\n",
      "We booked reservations at Paparazzi Restaurant in the lobby. We sat in the bar before for drinks (affordable wine list) and staff couldn't have been nicer.\n",
      "Upon entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly greeted and led to our table. Our waiter immediately appeared for drinks orders and handed around the menu. Our group ordered a variety of dinners: halibut, sea bass and short rib lasagna. Everything was hot, well laid out on the plate and really good! We all agreed that we were impressed by the standards of this restaurant. I had booked the reservation on www.opentable.com after reading reviews from tripadvisor and also yelp. The room (625) looked beautiful when I entered, so did the lobby, Starbucks and the gift shop. I set my bag on the round coffee table and obviously someone spilled coffee, how they got it up under the glass I will never know, but putting my bag caused the fluid to come out in little bursts, I took a towel moved the glass and cleaned it up, willing to over look the incident. I go to connect to the internet and there instructions are very unclear, I was told I would not be charged but it asked me to approve being charged anyways I called to inquire and the front desk person said she would take it off. She Did it never appeared. Later in the evening I made 3 toll free calls which they charged me $6.00 for there was no phone card in the room indicating that so I called the front desk and they had indeed overcharged me by $4.00. It was supposed to be $2.00 for the first 60 minutes. Even though there was nothing to indicate that. So I get up to take a shower turn the water on and jump in because I saw a bottle I assume was shampoo, wrong there was a bar of face soap, no body soap and a little bottle of conditioner no shampoo. I was already soaked and had to make do. Honestly I expect a lot better from the Sheraton. So I called down to hotel services and the perfectly nice lady, said she could give me 1200 points on the Starwood program equivalent to $8.00 . At this point I said whatever and hung up. The problem is the staff was nice, the property was nice but these small issues are what make a difference between a superior class hotel and a average/poor hotel. I have had a bad streak with hotels lately because in this economy you expect what you pay for, I have stayed at a Day's Inn and were more satisfied then at the Sheraton and to me that seems very strange especially considering the huge price difference. To sum it all up, if you stay here double and triple check to make sure you ave all your essentials dont assume anything. My mark of poor maybe a little overstated, but it is not above average. I did take pictures of the coffee stained towels (I dont drink coffee and the face soap and conditioner in the shower after the fact). Not really a satisfying experience for me sorry. I stayed for one night while I was waiting for an early flight from LAX. It's close to the airport, the rooms are perfectly adequate. The bar staff were friendly and the food filled a gap. Nothing flash but it works ok. We were disappointed when we stayed at the Sheraton Gateway. We arrived at around midnight. However, we were kept waiting to check in for around 20 minutes. During this time, we were not acknowledged and we were not given an apology, once we managed to check in, for the wait.\n",
      "I called the day prior to suggest we would be late. Upon checking in, we were advised our King room was not available and we would have to have 2 Queens unless we were willing to wait. After a late flight, waiting was the last thing we wanted to do.\n",
      "The rooms are fine although the walls are paper thin, so be prepared to listen to conversations in the next rooms.\n",
      "Although it was a very short stay, Sheraton Gateway probably on't receive our custom again. Hotelroom was very spacious, clean and luxurious. I booked this hotel because of its location ; easy acces to the city, the beaches to the south and LAX (of course). Hotelstaff was very professional and friendly. Wifi was spotless and the paid parkinglot a bit behind the hotel is pretty convenient too. My wife and I stayed here for about a week in October as first-time Los Angeles visitors.\n",
      "Check-in was pretty quick and easy. The FIRST room on a SPG member floor that they gave us was an adjoining room. And I previously had a bad experience with adjoining room where the neighbor was too loud with a family and the noise from kids was so prevalent that I couldn't sleep. So we asked for another room. The next room, on a non-SPG member floor, had a heavy smoke smell and it bothered my wife since she has a very sensitive sense of smell. The THIRD room, on a different non-SPG member floor, had a weird body odor smell. We almost puked when we walked in. So we finally gave up and said that we'll take the first room that was adjoining. The staff member called us about 5 mins later while we were settling in and asked us how everything was. I explained to him what happened and he apologized and said that he'd give us complimentary breakfast vouchers for one day. When the voucher was sent up, he actually gave us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay. That was a nice little touch. Under promise and over deliver.\n",
      "The breakfast buffet spread wasn't all that great. It had everything you'd probably expect except that the food wasn't that great. So we decided to skip breakfast on two of the days and gave the vouchers to ppl we saw checking-in.\n",
      "And just like everyone has previously said, the self-parking lot was not very convenient. it wasn't so much of a problem or an issue but just an annoyance that it's behind the hotel across the street. And a couple of nights, the lot was so full that we had to park almost at the end of the lot. And if you've been to the lot, you KNOW how huge the lot is. The lot isn't specific to the Sheraton. It's a park n ride for anyone and everyone so the LOT IS HUGE. And when you're coming back late at night, the side entrances of the hotel is locked/closed, so you have to walk all the way to the front of the hotel to enter. Yes, it's cheaper than other hotels like the Westin but very inconvenient.\n",
      "As for ppl asking about the airport/airplane noise, yes you can hear it but it's not noticeable unless you actually TRY and listen to it. It's basically sounds like the a/c or the heater just turned on or something to that effect.\n",
      "A few other misc. items...\n",
      "Good: Computer with internet/printer access, free Wifi in the lobby areas, nice lobby renovations, location is very convenient to the airport, close to rental car companies\n",
      "Bad: Bathrooms are dated and dirty\n",
      "Tip: If you're a SPG member, the SPG floor rooms give you free bottled water in the rooms. I noticed it cause I saw 3 different rooms and the 2 non-SPG floor rooms did not have free water bottles.\n",
      "If you really don't mind the inconvenience of parking, the hotel is a decent stay. I'd probably try another hotel the next time just so that i can compare but it's definitely not a bad hotel. Stayed here 12 Dec and really enjoyed my stay! Outstanding customer service provided by Dianne and John the Engineer!!! Thanks so much!!! The Sheraton gateway is simply the very best hotel one can pick in this area.\n",
      "Not only the property features high end decoration and facility, the most beautifull and functional rooms and suites I ever came across and spotless upkeep but more to the point the hotel team is simply one of the very best one can found in LA in the US or even in the world.\n",
      "I am a very frequent traveller >100 hotel nights/year, mostly through the US coasts and in Europe, and I have been to many place both locally and internationally and this hotel team rank as the best, one of the most friendly for sure yet at the same time also the most professional and efficient I know of.\n",
      "Their care for their guest needs and troubles and the length to which they get to help you along is simply unmatched in my experience\n",
      "And their kindness and friendliness make you feel right at home \n",
      "can not recommend it more I want to commend a particular staff member ESTELA ESTRADA for her assistance during our breakfast at the Rise 2011 Event. She was extremely helpful and went out of her way serving me and my colleagues. She was cheerful and happy to fill our requests. \n",
      "Thank-you Estela I stay here a few times per year for work. I wrote a glowing review earlier in the year but I need to update it. I can't believe how the service changed in such a short time. The front desk staff, as well as the gentlemen who bring room service to the rooms are still lovely and so helpful. But whoever answers the phone and takes orders in the kitchen needs to be replaced. I ordered all my meals from room service during my 3 day stay, and every order was messed up and brought to me incorrectly. Every single one!! The amazing room service delivery staff had to run around all weekend to correct the mistakes.\n",
      "I also feel like this hotel hosts so many events and large parties, that it is sometimes overwhelmingly crowded. I often times had to wait 5-10 minutes for an elevator, and then when it showed up, it was completely ful, and I'd have to keep waiting.\n",
      "Overall, it's a good hotel with comfortable beds and a nice staff. But I just don't think they have the resources to accommodate everyone when e hotel is at capacity. I stayed for a 1 night stay over a Saturday night. The public areas and room both seemed fairly typical for Sheraton; nice enough, with no real problems. Service was fine though I didn't ask for much. As an SPG Platinum I got a nice upgrade to a corner suite.\n",
      "But if you have a car, the abysmal self-parking situation would eliminate this place for me in the future. There is a third-party parking lot about a 10 minute walk from the lobby, which at most times has only one booth open for exit. During the day, it can take 1/2 hour or more to get out of the lot because of long lines (it is a regular LAX airport parking lot, not just for the hotel) -- when you combine that with the long walk, it pretty much eliminates any advantage you have from being close to the airport. They do offer valet parking for more than double the cost of self parking; if I ever end up here again, there is no question I will spend the extra money and use the valet. I agree with previous reviews that this hotel has some great positives.\n",
      "I loved the decor and the contemporary furniture. Front desk and bar staff were excellent, and conceirge helpful. We had a suite room that provided great space for 2 adults and 2 children. But the noise from neighbouring rooms was unbearable. And being an airport hotel people are checking in and out at all times. \n",
      "On the first night we were woken at 4am by the neighbour checking out, to be followed by a maintenance team coming into the room and making noise. I let that slide and put it down to an unfortunate experience, but the second night a couple checked in at 2am and did not stop talking unitl 5am. I dont think they were particularly loud, but it sounded like they were sitting at the end of our bed. The noise just came straight through the connecting door that was right by our bed. To Sheraton's credit i complained at check out and they tried to make good the situation, but i'd rather had 2 nights sleep than a free breakfast! They asked why i didnt complain at night but i didnt feel that they were talking that loudly, Its just that the noise carries. I should also say that there was no noise from the actual airport. So perhaps this is were all the soundproofing went and they just put up cardboard between the rooms.\n",
      "Its a shame as the location for visiting LA is perfect. Close to the beaches, museums, and an easy drive to Beverley Hills and Hollywood. This hotel is a typical Sheraton. Very large with lots of rooms and caters to the LAX crowd. There are two things that make this hotel worth it: 1) the parking behind the hotel is comparable to Lot C and 2) the free hotel shuttle. The lot is much smaller than Lot C but the same price of $12 per day. The shuttle actually only stops there and the Radisson so it is fairly quick and comes by more often then the Lot C shuttle.\n",
      "Back to the rooms, I agree with some of the other posters that the room wall are fairly thin, but you can't really hear the airplanes so maybe all the construction went into the outer walls....\n",
      "If you are a SPG member, then it is not that much for a free night and worth it if you have an early morning flight. Stayed the night before Thanksgiving due to an early flight out. We went to bed before 11pm to be up by 4:30am. WRONG!! Our neighbors came in at 2:30 in the morning and we could hear their entire conversation. We could also hear everyone's conversation that were in the hallway. These people stayed up for an hour talking. OH MY Gosh! \n",
      "The rooms are nice and the staff are nice but the walls are just too thin.Needless to say, it ended up being a very loooong day for us due to no sleep. Stayed at the Sheraton LAX for one night after flying to LAX. Great hotel for a stop over. Was able to check in at 10am in the morning (had to wait 30 minutes - but it was 30 minutes, check in staff didn't keep us waiting any longer then they said).\n",
      "Room very clean and tidy and no noise from the LAX at all.\n",
      "Shuttle is great to and from airport.\n",
      "Would stay again and would recommend to friends and family as a stop over. I stay at the Sheraton LAX a few times a year for business. Its great place to stay for business while in LA. I person that always stands out is Estela Estrada. A great server that always takes cares of our group. Always has a smile in her face and makes sure that everyone has what they need. Thank you for all your hard work Estela! This is one of the best airport hotels I've stayed in! Very close to the airport but the airport noise did not bother me at all....Yes you can hear planes taking off sometimes but the bed was so comfy and the room was so warm and clean that I barely noticed it. (I am a very deep sleeper though.) Our room looked like it had been redone fairly recently and the bathroom was nice. We did not take advantage of many of the amenities offered since we pretty much just used it as a home base and place to sleep while we were in LA, but it was nice to have a Starbucks in the lobby. The great thing about the Sheraton Gateway is that it is so easy to access all parts of the city from there. I would definitely recommend it for people who are visiting the city and plan on exploring during the day and just need a clean, comfortable place to rest after a long day. It was also very reasonably priced compared to the other hotels in the area. Nice and clean room, oversized bed and nice decoration. The breakfast is great. Many different options at hte buffet and gentle and kind personal. Free airport shuttle every 15 minutes. Estela Estrada was a great server and made sure everything we needed was taken care of. Her exceptional service made dining at the LAX Sheraton Gateway Hotel pleasant. My company had a sales meeting and the meeting rooms were spacious and functional. The banquet service was excellent. They accomodated all special requests with a smile, not like it was an imposition to get something not on the buffet line. Estela Estrada was especially helpful. I'm a vegan and every meal my needs were accomodated by her and her team. I also loved the fitness center and my executive suite had plenty of space. We were recently missed a late evening flight and ended up at the Sheraton for a brief stay until our flight the next morning. It's a great hotel with lots of style. Check in took a bit longer than we would have liked, but the rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. We faced the runway, but you could hardly tell - good soundproofing I guess. We were with our two children (10 and 13) and were able to order food from the restaurant to take up to our rooms. I have to say that the food was extremely impressive! Not cheap, but good to eat something of substance and quality. Upon check in the staff were efficient but not too friendly.\n",
      "Our room was dark and did not give a feeling of being clean. After spending the previous 10 days at the Disneyland Hotel and then a Westin this hotel felt very shabby. The bathroom was in need of a remodel and appeared to be quite dirty.\n",
      "We felt that the dining option were not really appropriate for the type of traveler staying at the hotel. The hotel is likely a stopover for travellers who need to be near the airport, the restaurant was a very fancy restaurant which you felt you had to dress up for (not something that most people who have travelled all day would want). Despite the hight price for the food, it really was subpar. \n",
      "The worst part of the hotel was the noise. Our room was on the bottom floor facing the pool, they played music well into the night at the pool even though no one was there. We had to get up at 6:30am to catch our flight and the music was once again playing. At around three in the morning a group of very loud people were running back and fourth in the hallway. \n",
      "Upon check-out the clerk did not inquire how our stay was, perhaps she knew. \n",
      "This was the first Sheraton that we have stayed and will be the last.....we will stick with Westin's. nice room, nice fitness center for an airport hotel. From parking lot/entrance is crowded, if you want to park yourself, you have to park at an independent lot behind the hotel, which is just a bit desolate at night and just a bit inconvenient This Sheraton is a large, bustling hotel. The rooms are well-appointed and most importantly, quiet. The Sheraton is close to the terminal and the shuttle takes less than 5 minutes. It is also close enough to several of the rental car lots to turn your car in and walk to the hotel if you have an early morning flight. A real feature of the Sheraton is a full-featured lobby restaurant arrangement. Casual food, a real Starbucks and a very good Italian restaurant allow you to meet your needs without leaving the hotel. Also a big surprise, the prices at the restaurants are very reasonable. Finally, a large, comfortable lobby bar with multiple seating arrangements and privacy top off the best choice for an overnight at LAX. My wife and I spent the night of February 25, 2012 at the Sheraton Gateway LAX as part of our 29 hour trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to Santiago, Chile. We found our room with king size bed, at a cost of $104 plus tax, to be clean, the bed and linens comfortable, and the flat screen television in good working order. My only complaint is that there was a $12.50 daily fee for wireless internet usage, so we elected to utilize the free computers in the hotel's lobby area. \n",
      "Of note: My wife and I enjoyed excellent nachos at the lobby bar. We also had the concierge book us a 7 hour tour of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills ($79 per person with VIP Tours -- pick-up and drop off at the hotel). \n",
      "Overall, I must say that I am very pleased with the Sheraton Gateway LAX for an \"airport hotel\". On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is terrible and 10 is excellent, I give the Sheraton Gateway Lax a rating of 8. I couldn't have been happier, I travel a ton, I like nice high end things. They gave me breakfast, Rudy at front desk was top notch and helpful. Watch out for the parking costs, although I found a great place on the street behind the hotel to park and did quite well with some free days. One doesn't expect an airport hotel to be great. it's there for convenience and location. This one while having a somewhat stylish room also had a television which was too dim (and when I asked about it was told that it was my eyesight - blame the customer!) a bathroom which not only lacked a bath mat but featured plastic cups and bath gel , no shampoo. The \"free\" wifi was ultimately free but first you had to be charged $11.99 to use it. I waited for 45 minutes for the shuttle at the airport and when I called was unable to speak to a human being. Another thing about the TV was that it paused for 8 seconds between stations while surfing. Not fun. But at least it was clean and soundproof. The Sheraton Gateway is a very large, airport hotel. It is situated close to the terminals (still too far to walk though). \n",
      "The public areas are certainly nice enough...befitting of a Sheraton. The lobby is large, clean, and decorated nicely. The restaurants are also nicely done. We had dinner one night at the Italian Restaurant. Food was okay...not quite up to the price tag. But not horrible either. We had breakfast in the Brasserie restaurant (breakfast buffet). The buffet was fairly good for $20 per person. \n",
      "The room was a VERY mixed experience! Upon entry, there was a very strong scent of body odor! It was quite strange and lingered throughout our entire stay. We did not say anything to the front desk because we were exhausted after 23 hours of flying that day and just wanted to to sleep. \n",
      "The bedroom area was otherwise nicely furnished and as others have stated, was large. It was fairly modern (other than the 1980s telephones still in use). \n",
      "Where I have to \"take points away\" was the bathroom. The vanity, mirror, and lights had been updated along with the rest of the room. But the tub/shower combo had the old 1970s yellow-ish tile on the walls, some moldy grout, and a VERY old fixture to control water and temp. I have had to travel to some remote areas of the State where only Best Westerns are the choice. It's the same fixture and tub you see in those hotels. Just not up to par with what I expect from a Starwood hotel! \n",
      "Other than the bathroom and the smell, the hotel was fine. Hopefully they can address those two issues! I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway while visiting my girlfriend for the weekend. It was wonderful. The staff was prompt and courteous. The room was spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom was also in great shape with lots of water pressure for the shower. Overall, a very pleasant stay. I also had a very early departure, and the shuttle bus was a very quick trip back to the terminals at LAX. Stayed at the Sheraton Gateway November 1 and 8 to bookend our international flight to China. Clean and modern hotel, good room, free shuttle just minutes from the airport. Very convenient for international flights. Attentive staff with good service. Hotel restaurant had a decent steak and salad which tasted wonderful after a week of Chinese! We stayed here for one night after arriving from the UK and before flying on to Seattle the following morning. We chose the Sheraton Gateway mainly because of the generally favourable reviews on Tripadvisor - although there are a lot of other hotels also located at LAX. Sadly it was a bit of a disappointment and certainly didn't match our expectations - and I simply fail to see how it can rate as highly in the overall pecking order of hotels at both LAX and more generally in the Los Angeles area. Let's be quite clear - it is simply an average hotel. It does what it says on the tin - nothing really badly but equally nothing that in any way wows you or makes it stand out from the crowd. The building is enormous - but from the outside to the public areas and into the bedrooms it really could do with being brightened up and modernised because it just felt old. The free transfer service was easy to find and took just a few minutes - but there was no direction from the driver on arrival at the hotel. He'd obviously done his bit - we were just sort of dumped along the entry road leading to the main door. Once inside the hotel the reception area was easy to find - although there were various barriers and signs regarding priority and this didn't make for an especially welcoming experience. The receptionist was friendly enough and got the job done - but where was the genuine warmth and personality or indeed any explanation of the hotel facilities? The best we got was the direction of the lift - and it was only after I asked about the included breakfast that some vouchers were forthcoming. Once in the room we were again left wondering if we had chosen well. Sure it was large and featured all the items you would expect - but the lighting was quite poor making it somewhat dark and it didn't smell that fresh either. The beds were comfortable and we slept reasonably well - but aircraft noise is audible. Breakfast was probably the high point of our stay since the self-help buffet was both extensive and of good quality. Once again though the staff seemed to be largely going through the motions rather than actually enjoying their work - there was little in the way of smiling faces or genuine warmth and we left without anyone noticing. Check-out was painless - the bill had been settled by credit card overnight so no need to visit the reception desk. But no opportunity for anyone to show any interest or ask if we had enjoyed our stay either. The transfer back to the airport was largely a repeat of our arrival - queue up on the approach road next to the appropriate sign then board the bus and get dropped off at the correct terminal. So - and the only thing that really matters - would we use this hotel again? Maybe - but probably only if there was no other choice or if we heard that it had had a bit of a make-over. Sheraton Gateway LAX exceeds expectations for an airport hotel. Shuttle service is adequately frequent. Staff is friendly and rooms are spacious and well above average for a sheraton airport property. I sometimes opt for this property over the nicer downtown locations. I have a great deal of sympathy for the previous reviewer. I was a recent \"victim\" of Qantas shutting down its entire operations over last weekend and I was shunted off to the Sheraton. By the time I got to my room (5.30am NY time, which is where I'd flown from before getting offloaded by Qantas at LAX) I was ready to pass out. Yes, I too was given a dodgy room. It had sheets and towels everywhere and had clearly not been made up. No apology given by check in staff. I just got given another room. Having said this, I think the hotel is completely fine. It was safe and well located near the airport. It is a good 3.5 star hotel. The staff seem friendly enough. No mini bar but a Starbucks downstairs. The bar and bistro were fine. They have about six computers with free internet in the lobby. I'd look them up again if I was stuck at LAX as it is very good value for money but I wouldn't book this if I was on business or on a holiday in LA. ...and this is coming from a hospitality major who has interned at hotels and also happens to be a member of Starwood Preferred Guest. HORRIBLE SERVICE. NIGHT SHIFT EMPLOYEES HAD BAD ATTITUDE, NO HINT OF \"HOSPITALITY\" IN THEIR BONES, AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I finally arrived at LAX airport after an agonizing journey that involved me missing my flight and my midterm the next morning. My flight was in 8 hours and after the horrible time I had just been through all I wanted to do was get a hotel room and get 4 hours of sleep. I was so distressed at the time that when I arrived at Starwood at 12 30am I was actually in tears, only to find that I had arrived at the wrong Sheraton and not Four Points (Gateway is more expensive and high-end). When I got to the counter and asked for the rate for 4 hours, the guest service agent looked down at me (I was still teary-eyed) and said in the most demeaning, least compassionate tone, \"It doesn't matter if you just stay for 4 hours or a whole day. 220.\" After thinking it over for around 10 minutes I was so upset that I decided that I needed the room and came back. But the two agents had already gone back into the room behind the counter and I had to wait another 10 minutes until they finally reappeared. Thankfully one of them had a little more humanity and seeing me puffy eyes and in tears at 1am, lowered the room rate to 180 + tax after a series of prying questions regarding my horrible night. I was so ready to head to my room and just pass out at that point, but when I got to my room and swiped my key (which was VERY far from the elevators and 7 or 9 floors up considering my time constraint) THE ROOM DOOR WAS BOLTED. An OLD MAN proceeded to come to the door in a BATHROB and informed me that it was HIS room, and that I must have made a mistake. Exhausted and even more upset at this point, I went ALL THE WAY back down to the counter, where only ONE of the guest service agents had reappeared this time. He was helping another guest check in, but even though he clearly realized that I had a problem (because I had returned after less than 10 minutes), and had little time left to spare, he avoided making eye contact or summoning his coworker until he was done helping the couple (-~10 more minutes of my life). FINALLY I got a new room key to my new room, and when I finally got into the door, despite flicking the light switch in both directions multiple times, THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN MY ROOM. I looked around for the cardholder to put in my keycard (because sometimes you need to plug in the card for the electricity to work), but no, the lights were just not working in my room. I was almost headed back down when exhausted and defeated as I felt, I walked straight into the dark room and tried switching on an individual lamp, which thankfully managed to turn on. \n",
      "I had a horrible night to begin with, but the inept and lack of service and the poor attitude of the Sheraton Gateway staff made my experience so much more exhaustive and awful than it had to be. Ironic that employees working in the HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY do not seem to know the first thing about being hospitable and are incapable of showing any form of sympathy (instead displaying downright rudeness) to a guest who clearly had been through a rough day. \n",
      "Don't even get me started on the filthy bathrooms... But needless to say I will never be coming back to Sheraton Gateway again. My trust in the Sheraton brand has been irrevocably destroyed. I attended a meeting at the Sheraton Gateway and provided excellant service by the banquet associate, Estela Estrada. I had Kosher meals provided during my stay and she did a superb job to ensure they were to my satisfaction. I would like to commend the outstanding service of Estela Estrada who is a waitress at a function held at the hotel in one of the ballrooms on November 1, 2011. She was really great and very professional in meeting the needs of the participants. She was very sweet and her personality was great! The food was very delicious and balanced. Keep up the great performance Estela! To be honest, I did not expect very much from a category 2 airport hotel. However, was pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent and the ambiance was relaxing. As an SPG member, they provided me excellent service and upgraded me to a junior suite without asking. The fitness room was probably equivalent to a category 4 or even 5 hotel amenity. I noticed that every time I looked around there was a staff member working or cleaning. I will give my hats off to management. Great job and keep up the good work. I would say that if the executive lounge had better food, I would probably have no choice but to give it 5 stars tripadvisor. Comfortable hotel, more soul then the Westin LAX which I tried.\n",
      "Seems to have more to offer guests and better, longer established facilities...\n",
      "SPG benefits better at the Sheraton - large room / junior suite, reasonable executive lounge, breakfast. ... Not only was my room great, it was spotless.\n",
      "Most importantly, I had to finish preparing for a presentation so I requested a late checkout- the woman at the desk (Diane Cheek I think she said her name was), let me stay for 3+ additional hours. This was crucial.\n",
      "Thank you Diane, and thank you Sheraton Gateway. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Delicious meals, warm and friendly service, and good accommodations. During my recent conference at the Sheraton Gateway, Estela Estrada made sure that my every need was attended to promptly. She greeted us every day with a smile and worked to make sure all of the attendees were satisfied. The hotel's food and beverage department should commend their staff on wonderful selection, great staff, and great service! Who would have thought that an airport hotel would be so fantastic? For a big hotel close to LAX, the hotel offers the traveler a fairly good option. The food varied from mediocre in the restaurant with little to offer vegetarians, to pretty poor in the bar and to spectacular for a Mexican lunch in the meeting room ballroom. Rooms are standard SHeraton rooms, fairly large and choice of runway view or pool and parking lot view but then, this is LAX. The major problem is lack of transport options to points of interest and even to restaurants nearby. This is not an area known for fine dining! The Sheraton Gateway is a pretty decent airport hotel. Its very conveniently located for travel with a free shuttle service that takes you to pretty much all the relevant locales within LAX.\n",
      "The room we booked (Executive Suite) was great - it was a quite a large room and I was impressed by the decor. In addition, everything kinda works although some of the bathroom fittings were kinda old. The only disappointment was that the 'executive' suite has no access to the executive lounge - but maybe we should have checked beforehand.\n",
      "Our only disappointment was the front desk - the IT system seems to be continually confused. Being an SPG member, my expectations has been shaped by the intuitiveness of other Starwood hotels with no error on our bookings (and the benefits/terms of the booking). When we checked-in the lady assigned us a Standard room and insisted upon it until we produced the booking documents. In addition, during Check-out, the gentleman behind the counter insisted that there was an internet charge (although we have been informed in the night before that it is complimentary as per the rate we chose). He insisted that he is willing to 'waive' it for us as a 'compliment'. Such attitude leaves us with mixed feelings about this otherwise great hotel. Stayed on the 7th floor and was quiet. Room wasn't bad and the bed was comfortable. The room we stayed in was a no smoking room and there is a card on the desk that states if you smoke in the room there will be a $200.00 cleaning charge billed to you. The bathroom was my pet peeve. Sloooooow draining shower / tub drain which bugged me. I don't like to stand in water backing up from the drain. I was surprised by this because I have stayed in hotels outside the U.S. and never experienced that problem. Thought the room was kind of pricey, but you are close to the airport. Flying planes did not bother us which may have been because we just came off a 14 hour flight. Has restaurants on the property which were ok, but again pricey. Best value for breakfast is the buffet, all you can eat which is rounded to $20.00 / person. The food was good and the service was also. The airport shuttle runs frequently and is free. Internet is like $12.00 USD a day (24 hours) and keeps billing until you check out. They have two bottles of water in the room that you can drink; for $3.00 a pop each.\n",
      "Big screen TV with cable and pay programs on it in the room. If you use the telephone....$1.50 for 800 number calls and $2.00 for a local call. We ordered Thai food from a restaurant a mile away and had to call from the room. I don't like being nickeled and dimed by places and thats what this feels like. Seems to be the norm in the States yet again; right up there with airlines now used to charging people for baggage and inflight movies and food and headphone rentals.\n",
      "All in all it was ok, but I might try another hotel if passing through LAX again. I've stayed at several Sheraton hotels recently and I must admit that they been sub-par or average at best. I noticed online that the Gateway had been recently remodeled and had mostly good reviews so I decided to give Sheraton one more try. I'm so glad I did! This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. EVERYONE I encountered was friendly and accommodating, the bed was super comfortable and I loved the gym, pool and hot tub. Hats off to the entire management team and staff members for a well deserved 5-star review. I spent 4 nights there and didn't want to leave.\n",
      "In this review I'm going to address some of the things others brought up here on TA so hopefully you can make an informed decision.\n",
      "There is a free airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes making it fast and easy to get to/from the hotel. If you have a car, the hotel promotes valet parking. For self parking, drive into the hotel entrance and head straight back past 98th street and you'll dead end to a privately-owned airport parking lot. They allow Sheraton guests to park there for about $14 a night. You will need to pre-pay and then will get in and out privileges during your entire stay. Warning, the lot fills up on weekends (I arrived on Wednesday so had no problem). I noticed they were turning folks away on Friday/Saturday. There is 2-hour street parking on 98th but you'll get a ticket if exceed the two hour limit so be warned. Valet is expensive -- I think around $24 a night -- about $10 more than self-parking. There may be other parking options nearby but you would need to check with hotel staff. \n",
      "I arrived at 1:30 pm and being an SPG Gold Member was hoping I could get an early check-in and a complimentary room upgrade. In my recent stays at Starwood properties Gold members don't get decent upgrades so I was pleased that the Gateway recognized my status and upgraded me to the Club Floor (Top Floor, 15th - with Key Access only). I was able to check into my room early but immediately noticed that the air conditioning was making a funny dripping noise (which was pretty annoying). I called the front desk and they sent an engineer up. At first he said I would need to change rooms but he was able to fix the problem after all. I received a follow-up call to see if I wanted to change rooms and I declined. Great service, no problem. \n",
      "The club lounge was really nice, very large and had a great view of the LAX runway. The lounge has a good selection of fruit, cereal, bagels and juice for breakfast as well as complimentary snacks for dinner. Beer and wine can be purchased from 4-8 pm for a nominal fee. During the day you have access to the lounge where you can work, watch TV, read the paper or get an espresso. A computer/printer is also available for use at no charge. I was able to print my boarding pass there. \n",
      "The lobby/entrance of the hotel is really nice and features free WI-Fi. Lots of people were hanging out in the lobby with friends, work colleagues or on their computer sipping a glass of wine. Very fun vibe. It has a W feel to it without the annoying drunk/party crowd. \n",
      "For me, the highlight of the hotel was the gym and pool/hot tub. The gym is big and has a great selection of modern equipment. As for the pool, it was like I had it all to myself. It's also open really late which is a big plus! The pool area has comfy lounge chairs, large daybeds, FREE heated cabanas (great for socializing at night) -- the space is very relaxing and well thought out. My only complaint for the pool area is that smokers hang out there and blow smoke all over you. I wish they didn't allow smoking in the pool area. \n",
      "The rooms are nice, updated and have great beds. Housekeeping was really friendly and did a great job servicing my room. I only wish there was a safe, fridge and iPod connector in the room. The bathroom was small and a bit dated but functional. I too experienced problems with drainage in the bathtub (as others here have mentioned). The walls are pretty thin and the first night I got awoken at 4 am by some really loud folks in the room next to me. It was really annoying but they must have checked out as the next 3 nights were really quiet. I love that fact that the room was totally dark with the curtains closed. Pitch black... great for sleeping. \n",
      "We had an amazing dinner Saturday night at the hotel's restaurant called Paparazzi. It's unique Italian food with a twist. With the tip and a bottle of wine, it came to $190 for 3 of us so it was pretty pricy but the atmosphere and food quality was great. Our server was also very efficient and friendly. He explained several dishes to us and how they were prepared. Be sure and get the artichokes as an appetizer. Amazing presentation!\n",
      "I wish all Sheraton hotels were like the Gateway. I will now look for Sheraton hotels that have been recently remodeled. Many of the older Sheraton hotels are in pretty bad shape. They did a fantastic job with the remodel on the Gateway and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. The service and friendliness of the staff really stood out for me.\n",
      "Congrats on a fantastic job Gateway... I'll be back! I've been at the Sheraton Gateway for a conference - eaten every meal at the hotel for 4 days including 5 where 600+ people were served. Consistently fine food, beautiful presentation, and excellent service. My special thanks to Estela Estrada and her associates! Arrived late ... left early. Very close to the airport terminals, so the shuttle rides are short.\n",
      "Check-in was quick and easy; the room had everything working, bed comfortable. Charge for internet annoying, but expected in these places.\n",
      "A late supper in the lobby bar was a disaster - very slow to be served and the meal was frankly inedible.\n",
      "Happy to stay agian, but will make sure I eat elsewhere. Really enjoyed my stay here. It was nice and clean and quiet. Excellent proximity to LAX, without the noise that is sometimes experienced at airport hotels.\n",
      "Fabulous wine and cheese party for guests the evening that I was there.\n",
      "Only problem: only valet parking was available and I hate valet. I parked off site, which was a bit of a pain Good location. Easy shuttle to AP. Nicely updated. Has a Starbucks in lobby! Easy to get to downtown. Ample of self parking across the street to avoid hefty valet fees.\n",
      "Restaurant in hotel over priced and food less than par. $25 for a dried up fried pork chop.\n",
      "Leave the hotel and eat else where.\n",
      "A bit noisy being by the AP. Window insulation is ok but you hear a constant muffled roar of planes taking off. May be an issue if you are not a deep sleeper. I've been staying at a lot of hotels lately (to say the least), but the Sheraton Gateway is one of my favorite for sure. There is a great energy here and the staff is fantastic.\n",
      "One of the Valet attendants, Henry M, is super cool and always greets me with a smile. He remembers stuff about me that even I forget. Great guy and I can see him running the entire hotel one day. They whole front desk staff is really nice as well. Arlene is so friendly and always very helpful and has a smile on her face.\n",
      "Some more vegetarian options in the Platinum Lounge would be nice, but I'm very happy with what they offer. If you're looking for a nice and friendly place to stay in LA, I recommend this hotel. My family of four recently completed our third stay at this hotel. It is our hotel of choice when we stay in the Los Angeles area. The rooms, particularly the Guest Suite, are spacious, well appointed and well maintained. Although it is located right next to LAX, airplane noise was never a problem.\n",
      "We enjoy this hotel because it is conveniently located, is easily accessible, the rooms are nice, but most of all, we like it because the staff is so accomodating. We especially would like to compliment Whitney Johnson , Ysenia (sp?) and Stephen Dycus for making our stay so enjoyable.\n",
      "I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member, but when in LA, I choose to stay at this hotel. Their customer service is outstanding! Hotel very close to Lax airport and therefore very useful if arriving very early or very late. Huge hotel and a \" Bed factory\" really but good overall service. Rooms modern and clean. Staff friendly. Bar quite expensive but breakfast first class. Will stay again My experience was great! Rooms were clean, check-in was a breeze and most of all, their customer service. I'd like to add; Diana Cheek was fantastic and professionalism, she went the extra mile in outstanding support (answered my questions with poise). Great job Diana!!!!!\n",
      "Me and staff will continue to book our overnight or couple night stay at the beautiful Sheraton Gateway Hotel. Thanks to all :) !!\n",
      "Aleshia My wife and I stay at the Sheraton Gateway whenever we fly into Los Angeles and we are flying further in the US. It gives us a chance to relax after the long flight across the Pacific and get acclimatised. \n",
      "The hotel is modern and well appointed and has recently been renovated. The rooms are clean, the beds and furniture comfortable and the service is good.\n",
      "The basserie provides continental or buffet breakfast and lunch. There is an Italian style restaurant on the premises for an evening meal. The Starbucks is open all day but closes at 5:00.\n",
      "The staff are accomodating about early check-in and late check-out. There is some aircraft noise but it is nothing in the overall scheme of things. just wanted to say how much we enjoyed staying here last week....we were tired and exhausted and the lovely young lady on the front desk called Anca could not have been more helpful...\n",
      "the room was whisper quiet and the bed was divine...the best nights sleep we had in a month of motel/hotel rooms..highly recommend this property This place was wonderful in helping us through a most difficult situation. My purse was stolen with our passports, identification cards, credit cards, and money in it before we arrived. The hotel was so helpful, and kind in assisting us in many ways. All the staff were great but very noteworthy was the assistant manager Stephen Dycus and Heidi Shiwoku on the Club floor. They were outstanding!! The shuttle left every 15 minutes for the airport and had access to a trolley which had on / off access to a number of sights and the beach which was fantastic\n",
      " It was the best stay we have had anywhere This is a lovely property -- great gym, beautiful pool. I was pleasantly surprised, for something so close to LAX. This is my second time here, and I would have said the service was OK, not great, until just now when Diane Cheek really helped me out. Some of the staff here really know what service is all about. I'll look forward to coming back here in December. I don't normally write reviews of hotels, but under the circumstances felt like I had to let others know. Checking into the hotel was a nightmare, after travelling all day, and having a reservation we arrived to find that they didn't have a room for us. Had to stand @ the front desk for over half an hour. Almost felt like leaving but the room was already paid for, so opted to wait it out. After finally getting up to the room, it felt like a \"rent by the hour\" place. Room smelt like perfume and seemed to have just been quickly cleaned. There was a disgusting stain on the pillow on the bed, so quickly changed pillows before retiring for the night. No fridge or microwave. Room service was expensive. The only reason we stayed here was because it was close to the LAX, but for the price of the room, I will never return to this hotel! I recently spent one night at the Sheraton Gateway, and I was quite impressed, especially considering this is an airport hotel!\n",
      "The shuttle is quick and prompt, but it was completely jam packed with passengers and one brusque driver. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the lobby area is spacious and attractive. The hallways leading to the rooms had me a bit concerned as they didn't quite appear to be as recently renovated as the lobby. But, once I got in the room, all fears were squashed - the room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. The blackout drapes did the job, and there was essentially no noise from outside or the hallway. The only odd thing - I didn't see a clock in the room!\n",
      "I did check out the lounge, and the Sauvignon Blanc was quite good, too! Spent a night at the Sheraton Gateway hotel last week and found it very clean, comfortable and efficient. The front desk staff were very friendly and informative. We had two connecting rooms which were spacious and clean and the beds were very comfortable. Stopped for a drink in the bar before retiring for the night and had very good waitstaff. All in all, a nice place to stay for a stopover. Checked in less than 60 seconds - always a good sign! Was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the room given that airport hotels aren't always very good. Needed to take the shuttle at 445 AM and only had to wait about 5 minutes. Took about 10 minutes to get my terminal. great airport sheraton hotel ,very modern ,great restaurant and great food.\n",
      "nice gym . new rooms with comfortable bed.\n",
      "hotel shuttle good and quick. hotel with good price. Our room was beautiful; but the bathroom was dated. Service was outstanding. The pool was a little small but very clean. We didn't spend much time in the hotel, but the time that we were there was quite pleasant. Stayed two nights late September 2011 in room 454.\n",
      "Nice room, roomy bathroom.\n",
      "Very good food, bistro breakfast.\n",
      "On site restaurant.\n",
      "About the only criticism was that sound from the next room \n",
      "travelled really well, allow us to easily hear the person in the next\n",
      " room on the phone. Best hotel I have stayed in close to the airport. Modern and updated, rooms very comfortable and bed was great. Front desk made a room available when I wanted to check in at 8.00am with two children, even though he said their were no rooms, he did find one and i was very grateful. Hotel shuttle was good and quick. BUT the hotel buffet breakfast was too expensive. The front desk was very nice when we got to the hotel to check in. It was me and my friend that was going to stay at the hotel. We called ahead to make sure that we had our reservation was in but the front desk agent that we talked to said there were no reservation so we just went to see what will happen. When we got there, MUSTAFA & EDDIE @ the front desk took care of us when we brought the reservation paper. They apologize about the problem and they gave us complimentary parking and made sure that we were satisfied while we were there for our stay. That is why this place a great place to stay if I have my family or friends to go there.\n",
      "Donjie Custodio / Melissa Hernandez\n",
      "check-in 09/18/11 check-out 09/19/11\n",
      "room #370 Easy to find. Good price. Pleasant room. Did not hear the airport at all. Good room service. Have to valet park is the only slight negative, but they were very fast at getting the car. It was always waiting for us by the time we got to the entrance. I have stayed in Sheraton Gateway a couple of times before, and the only reason I stayed there this time is because I forgot that I swore I would never stay there again. I so strongly dislike this hotel. The staff is difficult and no matter what you ask, the answer is always no. They charge extra for EVERYTHING and if you decide not to go with the valet parking (which takes forever to get your car) you are stuck at a public lot across the street in the back of the hotel. It is reasonably priced, but it is further away than you think and it has some antiquated system of checking cars in and out so you end up in a long line. You can't win. Wait forever and pay $28 for valet, or wait forever and hike to your car for $14. I called the day ahead to see if there were refrigerators in the room and there weren't...which is fine, but then I was told that I could request a fridge when I got there and as long as there was one available there was no charge for it. Nope. $20/day charge. Which also is fine - as long as you let me know when I call about it. The rooms are great (small bathrooms), but they are not any better than The Four Points Sheraton or the Westin that are both down the street and do not have all the issues that this hotel has. I would definitely suggest staying at one of those hotels over this one. Oh, I almost forgot. I am an spg member and I pay a freaking lot of money to own 2 weeks with starwood that I never use. At most hotels, I have access to the club lounge with my membership. Not this one. I will not be staying here again...and if good service floats your boat, you should stay somewhere else! When I go in & out of LAX I stay here. The rooms are clean & quiet, beds are comfortable & Staff is friendly. The shuttle is 24 hrs every 15 minutes. The only downside is the $21 breakfast...Really? I had checked in for one night in the Sheraton Gateway LAX. The check in took very long--even though I am SPG Gold. The room was clean and comfortable. Pool did not look to well maintained and the restaurant was overpriced and disappointing. Clerk forgot to give me the Lounge access which I am entitled to as a SPG Gold member. We booked club level room with access to the club lounge, free internet access, bottle water, banana, apples and breakfast. A desk with PC/printer, sofa, Flat TV and three major newspapers.\n",
      "The lounge also provide afternoon appetizer, have a bottle beer or cup of wine, and enjoy the view to the LAX Airport if you love to watch the scenes of aircraft landing. The woman who works in the club lounge has no smile on her face, but the gentleman is good, practice his language talent with us.\n",
      "Our room faces to the LAX airport as well, but cannot take picture over the window, as it was dirty outside. Room is clean and has a good size for 4 people, it is quiet on the top floor, but you can hear toilet flushing if someone stay as your neighbor.\n",
      "My kids enjoy the clean and warm water pool and fitness center a lot.\n",
      "Valet parking is convenient but a little pricy ($28 per night). There are two parking company behind this hotel with half price, if you are on budget, go for that. As we have kids, we prefer the valet parking, hassle free, save time on looking for parking spot.\n",
      "Budget car rental locates one block from this hotel.\n",
      "On site Starbuck has lots of choice, if you stay longer than 1 day in the hotel, participate the go green program when you check-in, you will receive reward of a $5 coupon for use at this Starbuck, it is expired prior to check-out.\n",
      "Free PC/printer provided at lobby for you to print boarding pass.\n",
      "The Bar cocktail lounge in the lobby has big screen on the wall; we had good time to watch the Michael Jackson’s performance.\n",
      "Customer service is very good, despite our room phone was no working after we checked-in, which was very frustrated after I tried few calls to front desk and value parking, it went to nowhere. I went out the room and found a lady who was doing housekeeping, she was so nice and allowed me to use phone in the room beside us that was not working either. She called someone also called maintenance person coming to check, and it finally works before the maintenance came in… \n",
      "Then my hubby went to the lounge to try WIFI, it not works on our iPad, so I called front desk again, they provided us free internet access in our room… Later we also received follow-up call from front desk to double check if everything works, and they offer us points for those inconveniences.\n",
      "Overall, we had a great stay at Sheraton Gateway LAX, thumbs up to the customer service. Diane in Guest services did a excellent job in meeting my request in a very pleasant and timely manor! Her follow though was exceptional too, calling me and making sure my request had been fulfilled. Her cheery and friendly disposition were very appreciated! I recently put on a conference for local teachers at the Sheraton Gateway LAX. We had around 48 participants. The food and service was excellent as well as the rooms. The staff was excellent and the prices were the best! I would recommend this hotel for your conference. Special thanks to Estela Estrada for her excellent service and help. We were arriving in LA after 18 hours of travelling, and wanted to stay in a hotel which was clean, quiet and with a comfortable bed so that we could get some sleep before starting our journey up the coast to San Francisco. The shuttle from the aiport was really convenient, the check in was quick and easy, and the rooms were lovely with heavenly beds. We also booked for the night before we were due to fly back to the UK, and spent some time in the pool and hottub before we flew. We didn't use the gym but it looked great, and made us wish we had brought our gym kiit with us so that we could have used it. Great Sheraton,with all the amenities required for a business traveller, or a weary tourist looking for an easy stay. Although we didn't stay long, it was a great pit stop. The beds were comfortable. The hotel lobby is under construction, but it didn't get in the way of our stay. The shuttle to the terminals took a while to show up which was frustrating since we could have practically walked to our terminal by the time the shuttle got us there. It is almost the very last hotel before you enter the LAX terminals, so you really can't beat the location to catch a flight.\n",
      "There was nothing extraordinary about the rooms. The decor was nicely updated. The only complaint was that the room had a musty, body-odor smell that lingered from past guests. It would benefit the hotel to steam clean the furniture or carpets or even put an air filtration unit in the room to freshen the air. The windows don't open, so if there is no fan in the room, what can you do?\n",
      "We ate in the bar restaurant in the lobby. The food was good - loved the french onion soup. Pricey as it was, it was nice to have good food available considering the only restaurants within walking distance are Subway and Burger King. I recently planned a medical meeting at the Sheraton Gateway and was very pleased with the outcome. Airport properties while convenient, often can be a marginal place for leisure or a meeting. The Sheraton Gateway is one of the exceptions. The service level was exceptional, two notables are Michelle Acosta and Estela Estrada. We would definitely return to the hotel. This hotel is convenient for travelers departing from LAX. I was not flying out of LAX next morning however noticed that the hotel has a 24 hour shuttle service to and from the airport (it is located within 5 minutes from the hotel). Noticed the walls are thin. I could hear people talking in the hallway, opening doors, walking, etc. and this is with my door closed. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. To use wi-fi in the room there is a fee of 10.95 per 24 hours. However if you have a feature call wi-fi on your cellphone you could use your cell phone as a server/modem and get free wi-fi in your room. I got this hotel through priceline for 117.00 a night including taxes and fees. Be aware that this hotel is being rated as a 4 star with priceline. In other websites the Sheraton is being classified as a 3 star hotel. For this price I could have a successfully bided for a hotel that reflected more accurately a four star status, such as the continental, marriot, etc. This sentiment was reafirmed at check-in when the clerk told me this hotel had been downgraded to a 3 star. At this point it was time to ask for extra perks, it never hurts to ask. I told the clerk to give me an upgrade from the room I was checking in. I was given an upgrade, however I cannot honestly say with certainly if I was getting an upgrade or not because I have no basis to compare with. I also asked for free buffet breakfast valued at 14.95 per person. At first the clerk said the breakfast was not included with my rate, however before surrendering the room keys he took out two vouchers good for free breakfast buffet which added a nice touch to my stay. I will not hesitate to stay here again, however I would not go through priceline again. Not to for this hotel Very nice looking/modern hotel. Concierge is great and knowledgeable. FULL SERVICE Starbucks in lobby that you can charge to your room. Nice modern business center. \n",
      "They have an Italian restaurant called Paparazzi which is very cool and plays on the name. Walls full of pics taken by a local guy with a story to tell with each picture. Very cool bar and lounge room for drinks. I LOVE Italian food and found their menu very limiting and foo-foo shi-shi. Where was the plain shrimp alfredo. None. Not even a dish with alfredo or cream sauce. Everything had too much something extra in it - mushrooms when I didn't want any, asparagus if I didn't want it, etc. And it was hard to read the menu - just give me plain english please. I ended up having a pizza from them (good pizza). One night I did order room service (stuck working and without a car) and the food was delicious! The menu had more selections.\n",
      "You can hear the airplanes take off but it wasn't disturbing. \n",
      "Also an EXCELLENT rate. $135 pre-pay (wireless in room is extra). It was prepaid because I was sent there for work and it was pretty much a guarantee I was going. Very surprised at the price. Excellent value! No fridge or microwave in room but I absolutely would stay there again.\n",
      "Getting around with no car? Have them get you a cab instead of taking a car service if you're only going a few blocks (CVS, supermarket, bank, Kohls, nail salon, strip malls, etc). You should be able to catch a taxi back or call a taxi company to pick you up to take you back to the hotel. Pros: Very comfortable, clean bed. The food arrived from room service within 30 minutes of ordering and the people delivering it were very courteous and professional. Antonio in the Brassiere; Gabriella and Jose in the Rendevous bar; and the gentlemen behind the Concierge Desk provided exceptional service. The pool area is nice and clean - eatting lunch by the pool was a pleasant break from my conference. The grounds are well maintained, and there was a security presence - saw staff patroling the grounds and lobby throughout the day.\n",
      "Cons: There was a party being held in the hotel one evening that reverberated throughout my room. I began requesting that the volume of the music be turned down at 10 pm, but it continued blaring until after midnight when the party ended. If you have children or an important event early the next day, I wouldn't recommend staying on the 3rd floor on a weekend.\n",
      "The wake-up service provided through the television doesn't always work. I used it for 9 days, but it only worked 7 of the 9 days. The services provided through the TV are all spotty - many times they wouldn't load at all, including the morning I checked out - I had to go wait at the front desk to check out.\n",
      "It was difficult to get service through the front desk on more than one occassion, and there were frequent long lines.\n",
      "The conference rooms are incredibly loud - high ceilings and no acoustical padding. They are also colored in shades of beige and gray - uninspiring drab colors. Another reason lunch by the pool was such a relief. I stayed at the Sheraton LAX last night. The hotel is non-smoking, or so they say. I went through 4 rooms to find one that didn't smell strongly of smoke. It still smelt a little. Some of the corridors also smelt of smoke. I asked the staff if this was a common problem. In separate converstaionso, one said it happens sometimes and the other said quite a lot. She blamed it on the high number of international travellers that stay there and are used to smoking in their home country or just ignore the rules. This was my first stay at this property. It's so close to LAX, you can almost walk there, if there were sidewalks. Solidly good property, personable and welcoming staff, free Internet access in the lobby with a good number of pcs, free airport shuttle service and good breakfast buffet at a reasonable price. Comfortable rooms with the typical great Sheraton beds. At least during my stay, this is a very busy property. Great soundproofing because I heard no airplane noise during my stay on the 3rd floor. Public transportation is close by but it's slow which is the southern California way. Santa Monica is close by for shopping and dining and you can take one public bus there. Mustafa at the Front Desk is great! I have been meaning to write a review for this hotel for a long time. I've been staying here routinely for over 20 years. You would never know this hotel is that old. It is one of the best managed and maintained hotels I know of. It is excellent is very respect.\n",
      "The staff are friendly knowledgeable and very well trained. The rooms are consistently excellent! The onsite amenities are excellent by the standard of airport hotels.\n",
      "My preferred LAX hotel highly recommended. Book early this is a popular hotel with experienced travelers. Nice hotel for the location, right next to LAX (really about as close as you can get). Free shuttle makes it easy. Customer service is good - Diane at front desk very helpful. The food in the italian restaurant here is tasty, but overpriced. The decor is worn and everything is kind of dark.. dark furniture, low lighting...not my favorite. But it has all you would expect in hotel services and friendly staff, so give it a shot if you have to stay at the airport. The staff at this hotel is excellent. They are helpful and service-oriented. However, be ready for walls that are literally thin as paper. We (including my 1-year old) stayed in a suite on the 8th floor. The room were connected to the rooms on both sides by a door. On both nights that we stayed, we could hear every single word from the people beside us. In fact, we could see their light through the bottom of the door. On the second night, we could even smell the alcohol. They were not particularly loud, but the walls were very thin. Needless to say, my baby could not sleep. Our room were also close to the ice machine. We could hear the loud noise from the machine every single time. Although the staff members tried to help, I personally would not stay here for this reason again. I just wanted to drop a note about the fantastic service and care my husband and his twin brother received at the Gateway Sheraton on February 17, 2012. My sister-in-law and I worked with Mustafa Oberoi to put together a special \"guys night out\" to celebrate the boys' 42nd birthday. Mustafa was nothing but creative, attentive, and professional. After our initial meeting, where we discussed my vision for the birthday surprise, Mustafa followed up with some amazing ideas that added such unique and personal touches. He went above and beyond the call of duty, and for that I was extremely impressed and grateful. \n",
      "The boys had a wonderful evening at the Gateway Sheraton. As I expressed to Mustafa, my family and I have been loyal patrons of your hotel for over ten years. My husband and I were married at the Gateway Sheraton and we have celebrated every anniversary, family birthday, and social gathering at the hotel ever since. \n",
      "Again, please extend my sincere gratitude to Mustafa Oberoi for all of his hard work. I look forward to working with him and the Gateway Sheraton on our next celebration. Stayed one night but it was fantastic. Great nights sleep. Bed is extremely comfortable. Room is spacious, clean, and nice. Would not have known I was right by airport. Lobby is beautiful. Starbucks is right there in hotel which is convenient. Staffis great. Quiet. Will definitely go back. Hubby is Hilton diamond member but may make the switch to Sheraton, Electrical cords hanging out of the walls! HUGE FIRE TRAP here! they did not even want to fix it! we demanded a new room, and got it in the end...\n",
      "Average airport hotel. A bit expencive comapred to the standard. Hungry and exhausted we arrived at the Sheraton Gateway at 9:30 p.m. Our room was ready and the hotel clerk made a reservation at Paparazzi, the hotel Italian restaurant. We never expected to find the absolutely delicious Italian food at an airport hotel. In fact we enjoyed some of the most delicious Italian food we had eaten in years. My first course was a caprese salad but not the usual fresh mozzarella. This mozzarella tasted sweet and as if it had been made hours before. The tomatoes were not commercial, hard tasteless rocks but succulent slices of three different colors topped off by a balsamic reduction. My entree was the lasagna which was made with slowly-braised short ribs and was by far the best lasagna I had ever eaten anywhere. Our waitress was not the usual sullen, overworked airport restaurant staff but a charming, delightful warm young woman whose personality made the meal that much more enjoyable. Because this was our first time at Paparazzi's we were given a free homemade scrumptious dessert. \n",
      "Then the room---absolutely quiet. I could not believe that as I watched a plane come into the airport almost in reaching distance I could not here anything. This was a miracle in an airport hotel! The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and spacious, and the entire experience topnotch. When returning back through LAX I wished that we would be bumped from our flight just so I could stay at this hotel again. Then I could savor another unexpected gastronomic tonic for one's weary traveled soul. My family has consistently used the Sheraton Gateway for a host of special events. My brother-in-law got married there; my sister-in-law and I planned a surprise 40th birthday party there for our husbands (our husbands are twins); we hosted family there for a 90th birthday party for my grandmother; and, most recently, we set up another birthday surprise for our husbands. On every occasion, I have been overwhelmed by the warmth and professionalism of the staff at the hotel. They have an incredible attention to detail and really care about making sure that everything happens as planned. For our latest birthday surprise, Mustafa Oberoi did an amazing job helping us to set up a bar and restaurant tab for our husbands, letting all of the staff know (valet drivers, bartenders, etc.) the ruse we were planning for our husbands so that everyone there was on board and recognized them. He went out of his way to find kitsch from their college alma mater, and had their room decorated with the gear when they arrived. It looked amazing. He also comped them champagne and cake late night to top off their evening. They had a fabulous time and Mustafa really helped to make it a special occasion.\n",
      "For the hotel itself, the rooms are comfortable, stylish, and clean, and the bar is fantastic. We will definitely continue to be repeat customers! This hotel is in a great location if you are flying early or late at night but it is very tired and needs a refurb now. The parking cost of over $30 with the tax is way over the top. There are no places to walk to for dinner so you will be eating at the hotel unless you wish to drive. Thye bathrooms are the smallest i have ever expeienced. the carpets in the hallways are way past their useby date.This is a 3 star at best Good room, nice breakfast (although a bit pricey), and 24-hour shuttle service to the airport. We were in a standard room on the third floor on a Friday night; the hotel was quite busy, and the hallway noise somewhat loud (the doors slam loudly). The approx $100 rate was a good deal; I would have been unhappy had I paid more though. This is the first time I have ever written a review but honestly I have never had such a negative experience at a hotel. I stayed there from 3/9-3/11. Parking was ridiculous. They wanted 28.00 per day to park my car at the hotel. They put us in a room that had a wonderful view of the roof top (those who have stayed in room 379 know what I'm talking about). We pulled back the sheets of our bed and there was brown stuff that looked like dry blood all over them. I tried to call down to the front desk but unfortunately neither one of our phones worked so I had to walk down to the front desk to inform them of this issues with the room. They moved us to a different room (room 618) that wasn't much better our sheets were clean but our bathroom was disgusting! hair in the bathtub and what looked like urine on the toilet and our TV remote didn't work. Luckily I had brought along some Clorox wipes because I was to tired to change rooms again. We were abruptly woken up at 6:45 AM in the morning to a child yelling at his brother to let him in the room which continued until about 7:30 AM. I needed to do some work while on vacation so I connected to the wireless and to my surprise it costs $12.95 per 24 hour period. I thought are you kidding me? After all of this and the hotel wants to get more money out of me? You couldn't pay me to come back to this hotel. Save your money and go somewhere else!!! Stayed here with the family for a graduation party and LOVED it. The hotel is clean, the beds are comfy and the customer service was impeccable, thanks Diane and the rest if the Sheraton staff. My hectic travel schedule landed me in the LAX area for one night, something I would not typically choose. So I was pleasantly surprised by the Sheraton Gateway staff friendliness and room quality. The shuttle to and from the airport was quick and courteous. There was plenty of staff at the front desk so check-in went quickly. The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and best of all the airport noise was not noticeable. Not sure if it was soundproof rooms or white noise, but I was not bothered by the sounds of aircraft landings or takeoffs. Pool was small but nice, workout room has a variety of equipment, and the breakfast choices at the restaurant were plentiful. Room felt very grimy dirty. Wish we had of stayed somewhere nicer. Pool was nice, although seems nicer in pictures. Breakfast in the resturant was good. Three times a year the Sheraton hosts our game convention. They always treat us with friendliness, respect. and professionalism. Estrela Estrada is just one of their outstanding staff. She did an great job serving food to hundreds of hungry Stratgicon convention attendees. I travel to this hotel for vacation and a convention 3 times a year. The staff Including Estelle Estrada, go out of their way to make me and my friends feel welcome and at home during out stay here. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone who has to stay in the area. Stayed here for one night between a long-haul flight arriving late in the evning and an early morning connection. I got a very good rate by calling an airport hotel consolidator when I arrived at LAX and asking about availability. The rate includes free shuttle to/from the airport which helps for travellers :-) I was exhausted, grumpy and grubby on arrival but the shuttle was fast (the hotel's very close to the airport), the staff wonderfully friendly, and the room comfortable and clean (although there was a problem with shower). Perfectly fine place to crash between flights and grab a few hours sleep if you can get a reasonable rate. Estela Estrada is the best assistant I have ever met at the establishment. Very helpful, courteous, nice, and eager to assist patrons in any way. Truely a great contribution to the hotel staff. I had a minor issues with my room and when I called to report it Diane at the front desk asked how she could make my stay great. I told her everything else was fine. But she insisted and gave me a complimentary breakfast. It was a pretty good, breakfast, too. \n",
      "Also, the night before the bartender ran out of my drink of choice while pouring my glass (it was probably a 90% pour). I think most would have simply tried to pass it off as a standard drink but he went looking for another bottle and when he couldn't find one, he gave me the drink complimentary. He also suggested another good option for my next round. I typically don't expect a lot from airport hotels. These hotels typically have a very high volume of guests who typically don't stay for much more than a couple of nights. In sum, I wasn't expecting a lot by staying here. However, I was extremely disappointed in the cleanliness of the room, especially for such a reputable and high quality brand such as Sheraton (Starwood). The room itself I found to be generally clean, however the bathroom was the worst. There was a lot of loose hair in the bathroom, the mirror had water spots on it, and there were dirty towels hanging from the top of the shower. I basically felt as if the room had not been cleaned by housekeeping staff before my check in. \n",
      "I also felt like the front desk staff was not very welcoming. I felt like I was a burden to the staff by checking in. The welcome was not warm or informative. Nothing more occurred here other than an exchange of my ID, credit card and a room key. Not even an exchange of smiles.\n",
      "Even though I will not recommend this hotel, I would hate to say, \"don't stay here\" based on my single overnight experience. The hotel is very close to LAX and nearby office buildings. It certainly provides a convenience if you need to be in the area. It also provides nice views if you enjoy watching airplanes. More than anything, I just want my voice to be heard about a disappointing experience I had here. I and my wife Shannon Coleman enjoyed our trip to Los Angeles very much, It started off rough we had to take a early flight that cause us to get here early, the late manager didn't have a room available nor would he let us stay in the lobby so we wonder round until the next day. After coming back Mrs. Diane Check met us with a smile offer us breakfast, she apologize for our trouble, in each day she check on us, told us about different area to to visit in Los Angeles. Because of Mrs Diane Check in Mrs. Arlene Smith I will be back. On my rercent stay, I realized my room phone was not working. When I used my cell phone to call guest services, Diane Check she immediately addressed the issue and offered a complimentary lunch for the inconvenience. I was extremely impressed by her quick resolution of the situation and thoughtful compensation. My second time at this hotel and once again, the stay was AMAZING. We were greeted by the valet staff with a smile, greeted warmly by the front desk staff, treated like royalty by the wait staff at the bar and got to stay in a great room with STARBUCKS COFFEE in the room. Love, love, love this hotel. You guys will too. I call the hotel regarding the price of the rooms and location. I call between 11:00am to 11:30am and I kept being disconnected or but on hold over ever. I was actually disconnected nine times in a row by the same person. Because I recognize her voice. I call to find out who this person was. And this lady with an asian accent who was not very friendly apparently was upset about something told me the persons name was Diane. I again call later on in the evening, and spoke with someone by the name of Anna who was extremely courtesy and very nice. She gave me all the information that I needed regarding the pricing and location of the hotel with one call. Kudos to Anna. Stayed here for 5 days, very nice hotel and great customer services, very close to LAX airport. Estela Estreda (Food and Beverages staff) was very helpful of providing food and services to our customers. I have a lot of hope for the Sheraton Gateway. It has all the look of a four-ish star hotel, & the service is impeccable, especially that of Miss Doyle, the Paparazzi bar's tender. I was also impressed w/ the ladies at check-in/check-out, one of whom even called upstairs to ensure I was satisfied w/ the room since my previous stay was far-below satisfactory.\n",
      "The first stay left me convinced that I'd been placed in the maid's quarters. Dried boogers adorned the shower curtain & bath walls. Mold & mildew were among the bathroom's assets. The coffee maker was too disgusting to use. And the fixtures were rickety if not altogether broken. Oh, and the chair... The chair!!! Rme. Think navy chair covered in a white dandruff-esque substance. Ewww!\n",
      "But my more recent stay was far better. My room was spotless, & breakfast was divine. Salmon & capers? Mmmmmm. Grits & maple sugar? Say it ain't so!\n",
      "Despite the dander that peppered my first stay, I actually love just being in the lobby of the Sheraton Gateway, & I enjoy the in-room views even more. Now if only I can get the Sheraton to love me as much as I love it...\n",
      "I'm \"Arnold\" on this one: \"I'll be back.\" Convenience from LAX is great! We just hopped on the shuttle right outside baggage pick up and in minutes we were in the stylish lobby...lots of inviting areas to hang out, a nice business center in one corner, exercise room that looked out onto the classy, relaxing outside pool with lots more great areas to sit and chill. Clean refreshing place that gave no hint of how close we were to the airport. Standard \"two double bed\" room had a nicely polished feel with very, very comfortable, cloud like beds. Nothing remarkable about the bathroom; standard, but clean. \n",
      "The Starbucks right inside the lobby was a great alternative in the morning. Some of us had a full breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and some had lighter fare from Starbucks and picked up some traveling food there too. This is a great place to rejuvenate if you are just passing through LA, or as a base camp if you are exploring LA. Joseph Martinez at the front desk was Awesome. Heidi in Club Lounge was wonderful. Luz in housekeeping was excellent. People were very nice and helpful. It's great being able to get to and from airport easily. we had a great meeting, service staff was great Estela and her beautiful smile made things so easy and always with a smile.\n",
      "thank you. A very welcoming Hotel from the minute you step inside. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are always clean and functional and the beds are sooo comfortable. Great after a long flight. Great amenities especially the fitness centre. Best brekkie buffet going around. I can't fault this place and always enjoy my stay. I spend 75% of my time on business trips. Often times I'm barely greeted by hotel staff members that seem as exhausted as I am. However, today I received a treat and was greeted by an upbeat, customer focused and dedicated Sheraton employee - Yolanda Padilla. Yolanda was genuinely concerned about me and my needs, asked about my day, and far exceeded my expectations. Her exception level of service will keep me constantly coming back to Sheraton and tell others of the great service I received. Yolanda deserves a raise! This is absolutely my favorite hotel that I have experienced in the LAX area and I have already returned twice. I've been lucky to meet front desk associate Joseph Martinez each time and have had a great experience. The first time, the hotel was extremely busy with a convention and I was unable to get the room I had reserved. Joseph was extremely accommodating and apologetic and made sure to secure me a private room that was actually leagues beyond what I expected for the price I had paid through Expedia. The view was great, much nicer than the other LAX hotels I've stayed at and the amenties in the room and hotel are just super nice. The second time, Joseph remembered me! He very kindly secured an extremely nice room for me - when I went up and it was accidentally still being serviced, I went back down and he immediately accomodated me with another room that was on a lower floor, but was even nicer. He really went out of his way to please me as a customer. The hotel itself is beautifully set up and I have only had extremely positive and helpful interactions with the staff as they took care of my requests for internet and some packaging for my belongings. \n",
      "It's kinda weird, before I just figured a hotel is a hotel and I don't need anything fancy or a particular brand, just whatever is cheapest at the time. My experience at the Sheraton here though has ensured that I will always seek out this hotel when I visit LAX, and will always seek out the brand first when I travel elsewhere. Thank you so much to Joseph and the other associates for some very awesome stays!! Well appointed large room. Altough situated at the end of LAX runway, the room is very effectively soundproofed.\n",
      " an excellent stop over site after a long flight. Great Rooms - good price - GREAT SERVICE. Diane Cheek adopted me. It was like having a local guide concerige-advisor - all in one. 40% travel is the job - and it would be so much easier, efficient, and doable if I knew I was when I landed in a town that Diane was going to be there on the ground for me. When in LA - I will no longer be staying anywhere else. My husband and our young son recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway for 9 nights. Although we live in Los Angeles, we were having some work done at our house and so had to stay in a hotel while it was being done. Our insurance company gave us a choice of hotels and originally we had planned to split our stay between another hotel that was much closer to our house and ten minutes from our son's school and only spend the weekend at the Sheraton Gateway. However, after three days at the Gateway we decided it was well worth the drive (about 40 minutes in traffic) to instead book the entire 9 day stay at the Gateway. What can I say, the hotel is extremely well run and although it's busy it doesn't feel crowded or overwhelming. The lobby area is beautifully appointed and could easily be that of one of the trendier hotels on the Sunset Strip or in Beverly Hills. Nothing about this hotel suggests \"LAX\", from the incredible breakfast buffet, one of the best that I've had (and I've had many) to the five star Paparrazi restaurant where I dined on one of the best salmon in papillote that I've had, to the scrumptious chocolate lava cake. The pool is sparkling and well maintained and the cabana area is light and airy and so relaxing that I decided to take one day off and spend it by the pool. They also have an extremely well appointed fitness room as well as a convenient guest only complimentary internet \"cafe\" off of the lobby. Thanks to the management and staff at the Gateway I can truly say that the 9 days that I stayed there felt more like a vacation then any that I've taken recently where I've actually gone somewhere! I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and first class stay in Los Angeles. One usually does not look forward to stays at LAX area hotels but my stasy Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles is an exception.\n",
      "It is a nice large hotel with full facilities located close to LAX.The rooms are well maintained and nicely furnished with comfortable beds.\n",
      "As a Starwood Platinum Guest I am very well taken care of at The Sheraton Gateway-really makes a difference.\n",
      "But the thing that really makes this hotel stand out-and the reason I stay here even when not flying out of LAX-is the outstanding staff.\n",
      "For example. Our waiter Horaccio in the Paperazzi lounge remebered us from a visit several months ago and greeted us as returning friends, while providing excellent service. The front desk folks were great as well,Friendly and professional. \n",
      "Speaking of Paperrazi-the in house restaurant,the food is really exellent! They have a new chef who is looking forward to bringing even more delicious Italian food onto the menu. This place is worth a special trip just for dinner! This hotel is very close to LAX airport. So close, that you can see and hear the planes landing and taking off. The hotel staff is very friendly and professional. My room was clean. The bed was really good!!! However, the rooms need a little update. They feel more like a Holiday Inn or Comfort Inn and less like a Sheraton. The walls are like paper towel. You can hear your neighbors. The hotel lobby, restaurants, bar and pool are nice. Valet parking is pricey. Self park is a much better deal. Few restaurants nearby. All major road are not too far. The best thing about this hotel was the room bed and staff. If you need to be close to the airport you should stay here. Spent 3 days here as a base for some LA activity as first-timers to the City and it was absolutely superb. Room was fine (hardly any aircraft noise to speak of). We were on the Club level and despite bathroom not being too new, this was not an issue as everything else was perfect. Staff everywhere were exceptionally helpful and went the extra distance to help out their customers. Breakfast was great (Club room visitors got free buffet breakfast at weekends instead of the Club room breakfast - more substantial). Club brekkie was still fine though. Staff in the hotel restaurants were great and food was very good. Didn't try the pool, but people out there seemed to enjoy it. All in all, a really enjoyable stay and way better than expected for an airport hotel. I would recommend it highly to anyone - close to LA tourist activities as long as you have a car. Hollywood/Bev Hills only about 20 mins away and Disney circa 35-40 mins. Only negative aspect would be the very over-priced valet parking. Convenient, but way too expensive at circa $24 per day. We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to departing to LAX. The location is prime, and for that you pay. The room/amenities are not worth the cost. The room we stayed in was dated in my opinion, and I did not sleep well. If you have an early flight out as we did, you might find the price worth the location- versus battling horrible LA traffic.... Spent 1 night at the Sheraton gateway, at the end of a vacation, the night before we were to fly back out of LAX.\n",
      "The hotel is pretty basic, nothing special. The location is great if you are going to catch a flight, and they have a shuttle bus service to the terminals. I paid a special rate by using cash + point on Starwood, around $40. The room was quite large, and well appointed, but the bathroom had issues: mildew stain on the showerhead, and some yellow colored grime on the toilet.\n",
      "There's a Starbuck's on location, which is good. $24 for overnight parking (there is no self parking option anymore, it's all \"valet\" now) is grand theft! I have stayed there before, and there was no valet back then. I wonder who came up with the rip-off idea...?\n",
      "Another bad idea is that they charge $10,95 for wi-fi Internet in the room, but if you want to connect with two devices (e.g. I-phone and laptop), you have to pay twice!! Another rip-off...\n",
      "I would stay there again, but only for 1 night, and only if I had a flight the next day. We recently stayed for a night before departing LAX the next day. This is my second stay here. I was greeted with excellent service at check-in. Being a SPG gold, I didn't have to request anything as everything I had wished for was mentioned and offered by the kind staff at the front desk. From king suite upgrade to late check out. I really commend on the service I received. All sheratons should in fact learn from this. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel facility is a bonus!. Our king suite was facing West Century Blvd and the runway but we really had no issue with excessive noise or sound as others had mentioned. The rooms do have sound proof windows. Being one of the closest airport to the LAX runways, one should expect some level of sound especially when one of the older cargo jets scream down the runway on take off!! \n",
      "The AAA rate we got was super,which includes buffet breakfast for 2 at the Brasserie. The selection was good and satisfying. I have to also mention the wide array of fitness equipment at the gym. Being a fitness enthusiast, I have to say this hotel gym offers more than some other top end hotels. The lobby s fairly spacious with relaxing lounges. Overall, I would definitely return to this hotel in my next visit to LAX. I recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles and I have to comliment the hotel on their staff. Everyone there was extremely helpful and very pleasant. I had a particularly great experience with Gabriela and Francisco at the Rendezvous bar. I had many gatherings there with customers and they provided a very pleasant atmosphere and great service. A good hotel to crash out after a long flight from the U.k.Efficient shuttle from LAX . The room was clean and quiet .Breakfast excellent choice and service. Staff friendly and pleasant. Good location to collect hire car and start holiday.Booked this hotel through Air New Zealand at the room rate was very reasonable. Gabriela always does a wonderful job in your hotel, she's pays attention to the customer and always makes me feel important. \n",
      "She does an a great job .............................I wanted to thank you for having such a great associate in your hotel. Bathroom was awful - see the photos. I had asked for a recently renovated room and they were unable at the front desk to understand what there inventory was. \n",
      "Bathroom door had holes drilled in it, stains etc. Guys, buy a new door swap out the hardware. The sink had broken and stained caulk...caulk and clean the sinks!\n",
      "Generally I like Sheraton...this was not good. There are a plethora of hotels adjacent to LAX. This is one of the better ones. The rooms are clean and comfortable, staff friendly, and its location is great. The starbucks on site is convenient, the restaurants decent, etc. We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel on the first and end nights of our Californian vacation. On both occasions we took the upgrade offer and for 30 dollars had a room on the Club Floor, free appitiser in the evening and buffet breakfast in the morning. Great value. Free internet in the lobby was an added bonus.\n",
      "We found the room to be very comfortable but would recommend staying at the rear of the hotel where aircraft noise was considerably less that in the rooms at the front. Staff were very friendly and helpful and overall we had a very enjoyable stay.\n",
      "This hotel kind of restored my faith in the Sheraton brand. I got this on Priceline for about $60/night.\n",
      "Overall I was not overwhelmed with the place -- it needs to be updated and for a conference center it sure seemed pretty empty.\n",
      "The shower was especially problematic for a tall person. But it did have a bathtub, which is not always the case these days.\n",
      "I'd only stay there again if I got it cheap on Priceline again. Whether it's a banquet, meeting, or just dinner you're looking for, the food service team at the Sheraton Gateway LAX are top notch! Whether it's Zee Bell, Sales Catering Manager; Estela Estrada (associate), Juan (manager), or any other member of the catering team, they attended to our every need! Eusum at the Paparazzi Restaurant was great, as well. Everytime I come to this hotel I am greeted by an awesome employee names Rheziel at the front desk. She always welcomes me and she remembers my name. When I check out, she always remembers to say \" Thank you \".\n",
      "In fact, everyone at this hotel is awesome. The facility is spotless with friendly service. This is the only place I ever want to stay when I come to Los Angeles. My company recently used this hotel for training. We had the pleasure of meeting and working with a lot of the conference employees. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I would especially like to acknowledge Estela and Roberto. Both of them had a 'can do' attitude and did everything to make our stay very enjoyable. WOW...What great service at the Sheraton Gateway. We checked in and had associates that exceeded expectations. Thanks to both Yolanda and Whitney for a stress free check in and out. Great dining experience with top notch, professional service. Thanks to our server Miguel for that! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants superior service and outstanding accomadations. The staff is always accomodating. Special Thanks to Diane Cheek for her prompt service. You are the best.. I had a wonderful experience at your Hotel. The Banquet Department, Billy and Lucas where very attentive. They were on top of everything and also they made sure we were well taken care of. The bartender was very friendly. Overall I would definetely recommend this Hotel to my Colleagues and friends. Loved this hotel\n",
      "SO close to the terminal\n",
      "free bus or $4 taxi ride away\n",
      "very modern rooms, slept great. Airplane noise is a factor.\n",
      "Great staff We often think of a Smile as Love; Welcoming. Beyond the Smile Ms. Estela Estrada in the Banquet department @ the Sheraton Gateway went above and beyond her continually consistant Joyfully Loving Smile to make us all feel as though we were joining this fine facility as guests in her home. Very Respectfully, Thank You. I stopped over in LA on my way to and from New Zealand last month and stayed at the Sheraton LAX in both directions. I have stayed at the hotel before and think it is one of the best in the airport area. If you are an aviation buff like myself, some of the airport view rooms have a great view of arriving and departing aircraft.\n",
      "The rooms are clean and very well appointed . The Club Floor is worth the extra money if you are arriving after a long haul flight as you can enjoy access to the lounge for snacks in the evening or continental breakfast in the morning. Free wifi is also available on the Club level.\n",
      "I have never had anything bad to say about this property however I did have a small issue with the bathroom this visit. Oddly enough I was in room 1565 both on my way to New Zealand and on the way back. During both stays (about 3 weeks apart) there was such a loud noise of air blowing quite forcefully through the air vent in the bathroom that the door to the bathroom had to be closed at all times. And when in the bathroom it was not only irritating but this constant flow of cold air that could not be controlled was very unpleasant. Especially when getting out of the shower. The bathrooms are definitely in need of some updating and this air vent issue needs to be addressed.\n",
      "My only other issue was with respect to the shuttle service from the airport terminals. For whatever reason (possibly just luck) it always seems as though the shuttle for the Sheraton LAX arrives at the airport shuttle stops much less frequently than the shuttles bound for the other airport hotel properties. Just an observation.\n",
      "I would still highly recommend this hotel to travelers stopping over and looking for a nice place to stay in the airport area. I got what i needed almost before i hung up the phone. Thanks for following up to make sure i was taken care of. You made my stay more enjoyable. I stayed here for four days on late March. Overall the property is fine and the service was OK but not phenomenal. Nothing bad, just nothing to write home about. The hotel is pretty close to the airport and also pretty convenient to the LA area(depending on traffic of course). Self parking is behind the hotel and was slightly convenient. There are some stores nearby and a Burger King which was about $18 cheaper for breakfast as compared to the hotel. No free wi-fi. I had the pleasure of staying at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles this week. It was wonderful. The best part of the stay was the customer service. Rheziel Sena and Antonio in the restaurant were terrific! On arriving at the check-inn desk we were greeted by Yalanda Padilla.What a welcome she give us.Offered us different options before we could make up our minds.This young lady has so much patience and good customer service.Our whole stay was wonderful and I can really recommend the sheraton to all my friends and family.Every staff member was polite and helpful giving direction to where we went.The buffet breakfast was really good.We felt like royalty in your hotel.We spent our annerversary at your hotel and you made it special.Once again thank you Sheraton\n",
      "Tiffany Richmond uk I visited Los Angeles recently and I stop by the Sheraton Bar and was my best desicion,\n",
      "I find a the best bartender ever see, Gaby is amazing, very courteous, friendly,very detailed and may you fell very special, she's one of the best bartender in the area 100%. thank you much for your treatment. I have clients in the area so the hotel is conveniently located but there are no bars, shops or restaurants w/in walking distance. If you are willing to take a short taxi ride you can get to some good spots... I would recommend Pancho's if you like Mexican\n",
      "I have to mention Juan in the Club Lounge -- what great service, very attentive, keeps the place neat and clean, any request you have he takes care of. Whatever they pay him -- he deserves a raise -- Juan delivers. This is a great hotel if you're flying in/out of LAX. since it's only a five-minute ride there by free shuttle leaving from the front door every 20 minutes. If you're not flying in/out of LAX, don't stay here! There's NOTHING except a half-dozen fast food places within walking distance. That said, there is a nearby trolley which can take you to Manhattan Beach and other attractions.\n",
      "A pricey, but very good breakfast is availabe in the hotel's Brassierie Restaurant. Prices at the other hotel restaurant with an Italian them were astronomical. Drinks in the lobby bar were priced decently and there was pretty good assortment of reasonably-priced appetizers and salads available.\n",
      "The sleeping room was spacious, updated and QUIET even though we could see LAX runways from the window. The fitness center is well equipped with a plentiful variety of machines, etc.\n",
      "Staff was uniformly friendly and there were free Internet stations just off of the lobby. I just had a weekend escape and we stayed at Sheraton gateway. The hotel is really nice, but what makes it nicer is the hotel staff. I wanted to mention Juan M. Ramos, he was great. We called the hotel at 9 pm because we wanted some fresh towels and Juan was knoking at our door 5 minute later with everything we needed and even more. He was amazingly generous, he offered his help with whatever we needed. I've been in hotel industry for years now and I really wish that more and more hotels in US hire people like Juan.\n",
      "Thank you Juan from the girls from Room 872 I arrived for check-in at 10pm and there was a very short (about 5-8 minute wait). There were 5 people working check-in. The person at the front desk was busy but VERY nice. The hotel was in reasonably good condition and the room was perfect. The lobby looked very busy (Saturday night 10pm) and there were multiple events occurring in the meeting rooms. This appears to be a conference hotel. Self Parking is $13 and a bit inconvenient. It is behind the hotel. It is about a 100-200 yard walk to the side entrance to the hotel. It was windy when I arrived and raining in the morning when I left. This may pose a problem for some travelers. If it does, you had better pay the extra $12 and valet park ($25 total). There is a Starbucks in the lobby and there appeared to be plenty of places to sit around. This is a great business hotel or a good place to sleep if you have an early LAX flight the next day. Ms. Erika Morales supported me by getting bottle water, slippers and helped me understand how to use TV and facilities. She smiles and takes care of me which made me feel like I was at home. I appreciate her help to me. This is very impressive to a visitor. Rafael Santo and Arlene Smith assisted me in correcting a billing issue that occured on my pervious stay. The serviced I received was professional, courteous, and immediate. Within a hour my issues was corrected and I received a corrected billing statement. Great service. I will definetly recommeding this hotel and continue to stay at this hotel. Being a frequent international traveler (and ex-pat), I find myself at LAX quite often. I have stayed at almost every hotel on the \"strip\" closest to the LAX entrance, and have consistently found that the Sheraton Gateway is simply the best in terms of quality, price, overall value. The hotel offers a free shuttle, which is very convenient (and runs frequently). Have a rental? The parking lot behind the hotel is reasonable; FREE street parking is also available overnight (restricted during the day). The rooms are comfy, although bear the usual scuffs, etc. We normally pay about 10 USD extra to stay on the Club Floor (at the top), which is so worth it at least for the free breakfast, snacks, & computer use, and most of all JUAN--who takes great pride in what he does: managing the Club and taking care of the clients. He really works hard, and long hours (like many of us) and we most certainly appreciate this dedication, especially in an industry with high turnover. On balance, there are a lot of choices out there, but Sheraton offers quite a bit for the price. Oh, there is a Starbucks in the Lobby as well--for that essential coffee to go! The pool is gorgeous. Diane in guest relations has been very helpful. I would recommend this property to anyone. I was at the hotal for a three-day series of meetings of educators from over about California cities, and we were very pleased with the facilities and service. Among others, we appreciated how Roberto and Estela made our meal service warm and friendly -- always a plus after hours of talk! Great location, easy access to freeways. Juan in the lounge (15th floor) is excellent. He is congenial, works hard and very nice! Overall a great experience. Shuttle from airport timely. Check in was quick and easy with friendly staff. Room was $105 but not sure if that's simply because of my business pricing. My room was decent enough, but I guess I had higher expectations for Sheraton. The bathroom was dated and small and not as clean as I would have liked. Bed was great!! Super comfy with lots of pillows. My heat/air made noise all night long so sleep was lacking. Sounded like someone in the wall stepping on a loose floorboard over and over again! Although right by the airport, I didn't seem to hear any noise, though I could see the planes from my view. Shower seemed to have been designed for short folk and I'm only 5' 7\" but thought I was going to fall over backwards to wash my hair! Tub didn't drain well either, but on the positive the water pressure was great! Wireless wasn't working for me so colleague brought me the network cord he had in his room (hmmmshould I have had one?) Seemed silly to be charged for internet access these days...especially since wireless within the hotel lobby was free.\n",
      "Restaurants- dinner at Paparazzi my first night was fantastic- really tender filet! Served by Mindy- nice and friendly. Lounge food ok- burger was a bit rubbery and dessert (apple crisp) slightly overcooked. Music was annoying- same beat and sounds like it should have been at a rave or something. Gabriella was super friendly though. Breakfast buffet $20, but other options alone were almost as much so I bit the bullet and had small bits of everything. If you opt for no housekeeping you get a coupon for $5 off food. Nice touch!\n",
      "All in all not bad- would stay here again. Great Rate\n",
      "Extremely comfortable beds\n",
      "Excellent business center\n",
      "Great Subway next door & Starbucks in this hotel (How could you lose)\n",
      "Somewhat noisy AC (But it worked well)\n",
      "Somewhat hollow door (I could hear my kids from down the hall.. :)\n",
      "All in all a good pick...! Fantastic exercise room, wonderful pool area and very quiet rooms Great hotel for LAX. Has a shuttle service and great views of the runways for plane spotting. Generally the service is good. The valets I think are an outside company and are a total joke - incompetent, rude, slow, and that is using tripadvisor friendly terms. Took 7 requests and 23 minutes to get a car at 10:20 in the morning. Not peak time. The car finally was 'found' after 5 people got involved and that was after a lot of shrugging and passing the buck. My colleaague was told several times the car was \"on the way\" when it was obvious they had no clue - especially since they found the key still sittin at the valet desk 15 minutes in. The hotel staff in general is friendly and helpful. The elevators are VERY slow - plan well ahead if you have to meet people downstairs. The Club floor and rooms are nothing special, but decent and quiet. The hotel and rooms are somewhat dated, but a very decent airport hotel. Starbucks in lobby is nice and the gym is fairly good. Nice pool area for warmer LA days. I have stayed at this hotel MANY times. It is very adequate for the business traveler. There does not seem to be a lower price point for food in the evening. The Starbuck's closes early and the only food option is a very spendy bar or restaurant menu. I usually walk over to the Crowne Plaza right next store and get a wood fired oven roasted pizza. They are delicious and about $12. \n",
      " Although I usually sleep well at this hotel, I could hear my next door neighbor on his phone. The interior soundproofing could use some attention. I would like to Thank Estela Estrada for her attention and willness to provide customer service... she was always on top of things and making sure we were satisfied as was all the staff during our conference. Great place to meeting. again thank you all. We are Starwood Gold Preferred card holders so we were upgraded to the executive room which turned out to be really was nothing that special. It seemed like any other standard room except they provided a bathrobe. The room was very clean; the duvets and bed also comfortable. The blue airport shuttle was prompt and serviced a few other hotels too. We had a buffet breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was $20 each but the most economical choice in the restaurant given that single entrees averaged $15 in any event. There is a new Starbucks in the lobby too. The check-in staff and concierges' service was very good. We got the room for $100 per night. I don't think I'd pay more than this for this hotel though. The lobby is quite dark and so is the lighting in the rooms. I didn't like that WIFI is $12 in the room (although it's free in the lobby). There is a $5 shuttle to Manhattan Beach from the hotel too. The outdoor swimming pool did not have any lounge chairs out as it was too cold. The hotel was clean and had lots of amenities. The staff was friendly, especially Estela Estrada, who was efficient, charming and courteous. My experience at this hotel was first rate, clean rooms, friendly staff, efficient parking, excellent b'fast, and more. The only negative worth mentioning is the desk chair which was broken down.\n",
      "Gabriela S at the bar took very good care of me and other guests for lunch and dinner times when the main restaurant was closed or not the right atmosphere. best service and attention provided by the hotel personal specially Mustafa H Oberoi Diane Cheek was amazing She Made me feel at home and wanted. A Pleasure to stay here we will be back with the Strategicon conventions. immediate service and friendly. That is what I expect at a hotel like this. No worries! I was on the 9th floor of your hotel, and I must tell you that each and every one of your maids and cleaning staff where so friendly and courteous. I found that all of the rest of your staff where also very accommodating where ever I met them. I was there for the Bachata Congress and it was a wonderful event that I had a great time attending. We ate at the Papparazzi Restaurant. Ms. Estela Estrada was the associate who catered to us during our VIP Breakfast. She was attentive, courteous, and professional. We enjoyed our experience during the PMAG Conference, and especially the wonderful serive Ms. Estela Estrada provided that morning. I travel weekly for business. This hotel is a gem. The staff is exceptional! Every touch point of the staff is friendly, accommodating, and anticipative (from the curbside to the valet, lobby, bell desk, restaurant both breakfast and /or dinner, to house keeping...). After 60 nights of stays in the past 4 months, my sampling is a solid reflection of what you will encounter. Not once have I met or seen a grumpy head employee. I have found alternate hotels closer to the beach, a little less expensive, but no one has come close to the customer service level of this staff's happy demeanors which becomes contagious. \n",
      "All employees are part of an A Team, with special mention going to: Romain, Mario, Kerri and Horazzio and Irene to mention a but a few. \n",
      "Thank you for making my time on the road, away from family less of a distraction by providing a new level of customer service with exceptional attitude and attention to detail!\n",

      "Denver Colorado I travel to LA frequently for business and always stay at the Sheraton Gateway because of their close proximity to the airport. The hotel staff is very accommadating, especially the Front Desk Staff. On my most recent visit I had a minor issue with my room. I called down to the Front Desk and Diane took care of it within seconds. That's the type of friendly service you expect when you visit various hotels. I definitely recommend this hotel to others. I ate at the Paparazzi bar (inside the hotel) twice. The food was fantastic. The decor is really cool - doesn't feel like you're in a hotel bar/restaurant at all. And most importantly the service was incredible. Horatio, the bartender, was friendly, attentive, and very helpful - even though I was traveling alone he made me feel welcome and like a regular! Both nights the manager, Romain, came to make sure everything was great. I will definitely be back. We came back from Menzanillo, Mexico and were very very tired from the trip. The Shuttle picked us up at the LA Airport, with hardly any waiting time. We checked in the hotel and had requested the 15th floor. We were given a non smoking room on the 14th floor. There was free bottled water, ice, clean luxurious king size bed, nice soap, shampoo and lotion in the bathroom. In the room is free Starbuck Coffee and cream/sugar. What a nice way to start the day. We slept like logs and the room was nice, quiet, private and clean. We would definitively return to that hotel. Chose this hotel because of reputation, proximity to LAX, free shuttle & as only overnighting alone, wanted somewhere safe, clean etc. Very disappointed to arrive and get no service from driveway staff AT ALL. Shuttle driver was great BUT Sheraton staff not interested in guests arriving by shuttle (obviously).....same for reception staff. Got help to room with luggage only after asking for it. Bathroom was small & on closer inspection - FILTHY! Urine around base of /AND long dark hairS attached to floor screws of toilet. Used shower cap and hair on shower curtain. Bed was comfortable. Morning buffet b'fast -No options for \"light eaters\" - overcharged as full buffet. Never again. I reviewed prompt customer services beyound my expectations from Daine Check, The consistencey of service was more than what I normally receive from during business travel from Daine. I would highly recommend the Sheraton Gateway as a place of stay during business or pleasure travel. We only stayed for 1 night due to an early LAX flight but it was a good value. The service was great and professional. The room was clean. They had a Starbucks on sight which is always a plus. Great location if you are flying out early. The hotel is very accommodating. The rooms are very nice and large. If there's something you need and don't see it or have it in your room, call the front desk and you will be greeted with kindness. The area has lots to offer within walking distance if you know where to go. I`ve been your guest 2 times and both the service and the facilities where Excelent .. every single associate works with a spirit of excellence they surpassed my expectations.\n",
      "Estela Estrada was my favorite, she is always smiling, giving her best, not only to me but every client !! Congatulations !! the bathrooms are ALWAYs clean no regardless the amount of people at our conference !!!\n",
      "Sol Padilla.\n",
      "Mexico We stayed here before our Hawaiian vacation and we found it to be most convenient to LAX. It was very clean and the staff was all very helpful. I don't know about spending a vacation here, but it's great for accessing the airport the next day. We normally stay at the Westin Los Angeles Airport when we are in the area, but recently decided to try the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel for the second time and we were pleasantly surprised as a guest to the hotel. The service was at a higher standard than previously. Our morning room service arrived within 15 minutes which normally takes 30 to 40 minutes at most hotels. The service at the bar was always timely. As a Platinum member we always receive a great room upgrade unlike the Westin Hotel. The higher standard of service at the Sheraton Gateway has changed our view of the hotel and is now our choice over the Westin hotel. \n",
      "Kudos to Management and their staff. Dianne Cheats was very professional and helpful with guest services! The food at the restaurant was excellent. Estele Estrada and catering team did an outstanding service during our reception at the hotel. She and the team provided excellent service and all with an excellent attitude and an awesome smile. Catering team was awesome! Thank you. We stayed for one night on a stop over in order to catch a flight the next day. We were expecting noise from the airplanes as the hotel is quite near to the airport but we never hear the air planes at all. Overall, it was a good stay. The rooms are clean and the front desk and concierge were very helpful. We would stay here again if I am on transit to another city. Stayed here in June 2010 with my partner. Really enjoyed our 2 night stay here. Nice bar food and breakfast, great location for those who want to be close to the airport. Lovely swimming pool with loungers etc and good fitness centre also. Our room was spacious and the bed was really comfy. Staff were very helpful in helping us organise a trip to Disney. I stayed heare for one night prior to a flight out of LAX. The hotel was close to the airport and was clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at check in. The rooms were clean and the hotel had free Wifi in the lobby and a shuttle to the airport.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel if flying out of LAX for it's comfort and convenience to the airport. Whilst the rate we got was excellent $100AUD a night we were underwhelmed by the room and service. No fridge. Basic room. Had to pay for wifi in room. Breakfast buffet is sub-standard. No really good healthy offerings. Service is efficient ie fast but not too good at listening. ie specify just eggs and bacon and get hash browns as well???\n",
      "Pool is nice.\n",
      "Gym is good. We conducted 3 days worth of meetings at the Sheraton Gateway. The staff was very helpful. Steve, the \"audio/visual\" guy was very helpful. Estela Estrada took care of our room and ensured that our needs were met. This type of attention ensured we had a successful meeting. I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway with three young children on a stopover between Australia and South America. We arrived at the hotel after a 14 hour flight and a 3 hour detainment at LA airport (where I found immigration staff to be surprisingly rude). Reception allowed us to check in three hours before the advertised check-in time for which I was extremely grateful. The rooms were comfortable and notably, the beds were wonderful. I could not recharge my iPod but that's being a bit fussy. The spa and pool were open until midnight and my kids and I were thrilled to be able to have a late swim. The outdoor spa was terrific on a cold LA night, and you do not have to go hunting for towels.\n",
      "Breakfast was not included in our online booking so double-check if you want it. In-room coffee would have been appreciated. Denny's is a kilometre's walk from the hotel and provides a good, inexpensive meal, especially if you have children.\n",
      "We will be staying at the Sheraton Gateway again. I was underwhelmed with the experience at this Sheraton. While the location is OK, in my view for the money paid there are better options around LAX. I must have got check-in on a bad evening. Checked in at 11pm, just me and one staff member who was very obviously not happy to be at work that day and determined to make everyone else's day just as bad as theirs. Room was average, breakfast average, price above average, parking expensive etc. Service was great in Starbuck's and the bar. I won't be going back to the Sheraton, been at LAX a number of times since and stayed elsewhere. I stayed here in December just for one night while breaking up the flight from NZ to UK. Travelling by myself with a large suitcase I found everything- from shuttle pick up to checking out a pleasure. The shuttle bus was quick and efficient and easy to find. No queue for check in and even though I was earlier than check in time they gave me a room immediately. The concierge helped me to find a bus to Santa Monica and off I went. The starbucks in the hotel was a godsend and made nicer by the extremely friendly staff. (even got a complimentary tea when their till was not working) In the night I opted not to eat in the hotel, again the concierge gave me a map and marked on it where In n Out burger was, about a 10/15 minute walk. I had breakfast in the morning in the hotel off the a la carte menu which was ok, but at least it was quick. The main joy for me, especially being a solo pregnant traveller was how all the staff, reception, cleaners, wait staff were so friendly and quick to give a smile - nice when you really have spoken to anyone in the past 24 hours! Recommend and am staying there again at end of week when I do the trip back to NZ. It seemed a good idea to make an online booking for a King room on the Executive Floor (with a late check out) before embarking on the evening flight to Australia, except when I arrived after midnight from the East Coast there was no available King bed and the Executive Lounge was not in operation until the following week! I asked for a \"downgrade\" as it was a waste of money for non-existing services, despite the offer of an appertiser in the bar (at 12.45am) and a breakfast coupon. When the key did not work for the third room offered to me and I had hauled my luggage for the third time through the corridors, the clerk on the front desk, new on the shift, took me and my luggage to the room and apologetically did her best to placate me with the offer of a $50 credit on food - so I ordered room service. The 3 rating is for her making up for the less able clerk earlier in the evening who just did not get it! \n",
      "This is a very convenient hotel and has a great lobby with great wi-fi (I think it was even free) and very comfortable and private armchairs and chaise longues to pass the time between check -out and a late flight. I checked my bags with the bell boy and took the Ocean Trolley to Manhattan Beach and Manhattan Village and would say it was one of the best $5 buys I have made - again a great way to get away from LAX for a few hours without the hassle of renting a car, and there are great cafes by the ocean and friendly drivers on the Trolley which stops outside the Sheraton and good shopping at the Village trolley stop. The hotel rooms are supposedly \"refurbished\" but I have stayed here before and my recollection is that the rooms were much better presented before. My positive recommendation is based on the location and the excellent lobby areas as well as good rates online if you can pick the right combination. The proximity to the airport made this a convenient location for a business meeting. From the porte cochere to the lobby, the hotel has a hip, club-like atmosphere that I suppose is evocative of the LA scene. The rooms and facilities however are standard and adequate for business. The staff was very friendly, and provided prompt, coureous, and professional service. I would like to recognize Merly Pickett in particular. He performs his services professionally and takes pride in his work. The Gateway at LAX is a great hotel with its location to the airport, but the staff were Incredible. We were there for just one night for our morning flight to Cancun and had spent the afternoon at the RV show in Pomona. We had not eaten any real food that day and when we arrived at the Gateway were disappointed that the restaurant was closed for dinner on Sundays. We didn't want to eat in our room , so the desk clerk gave us vouchers for food at the sports bar. Since it was a Sunday the bar was packed with people for Sunday Football-But that is what made for a fun evening. The wait staff were very friendly, made us feel like we were more then just another hotel guest.The service with our food and drinks was prompt even with the large amount of people in the bar area. \n",
      "The front desk clerk also gave us vouchers for the buffet breakfast the next morning, which was very good with excellent service.\n",
      "We first stayed at this Sheraton in 1982 for the first night of our honeymoon when the hotel was called the La Reina. We had stayed there several times over the years, but this was our first time there since it became the Gateway. The service has always been great, but now it is excellent. We will return! Great time, great hospitality. Associates Gabriela, Everardo (bartenders), Henry & Manny (concierges) were very helpful. I loved the hotel staff - very friendly - \n",
      "I want to thank Estela Estude who helped me when i planned my new year event - her willingness to go the extra mile for my event caught my attention - i cannot thank her enough for this.\n",
      "If your supervisor is reading this - he should add this as a Kudos in your file - Great Job Ma'am.\n",
      "Thanks Sheraton for being friendly (esp in a big city like LA - where friendliness is uncommon) I want to first make reference to three amazing staff members of the Sheraton Gateway Hotel. Jose Monroy, Martha Guerrero, and Estella Estrada. I was part of an organizing committee of a large group and they made our lives so much easier. If we needed dinner or lunch served in another ballroom they were there to help fully. They were very helpful when we need more plates and were able to get bring them quickly. The audio/visual was very helpful with explain who to use the system. It was a very smooth between 26 Dec 2010 and 31 Dec 2010 for all of the ~90 members. The whole front desk staff was very understanding and accommodating even when we may have been aggravating. The beds were very comfortable and house keeping was very helpful. Great Job and keep up the good work! To whom It may concern,I would like to take the time to tell you that you have an outstanding employee in Diane Cheek.I checked into your hotel really late(around 2am) from an extremely hard work day, and didnt get to bed until around 3am.I awoke(7am) to a family next to me with a screaming child and pounding on the walls.I tried to let it go but it continued to go on for another hour and this is when I called down to the front desk and spoke to Diane Cheek.The customer service I received was outstanding.Diane said she would send security up and take care of this matter.I received a call about 10 minutes later and Diane was very apologetic and even offered me a free breakfast.These kind words,gestures, and some much needed sleep was very appreciated.A big THANK YOU to Diane Cheek. Sincerely, Rhonda Wells We liked the idea of the Club Floor because we like the lounge Happy Hour and Breakfast at Sheraton properties. At booking we were advised the Club Lounge would be open...it wasn't over the holidays. Check-in offered an alternative with appies in the 'Rendevous Lounge\" and the buffet breakfast in the main restaurant. Rendevous had four (boring) items for appetizers and the vibe of the lounge did not work for us. However, breakfast was very good with great service staff. Bed was great, though we were missing both bathrobes and a guest directory in our room. Room service trays from other rooms lanquished on the Club Floor hallway for hours (had breakfast items on it) until I spotted a supervisor with a clipboard to address it. \n",
      "I found the overall product wobbly, a bit pricy and has service inconsistency, but it is much better than surrounding alternatives. Hotel lobby was very impressive and check in was easy. Downside had trouble sleeping because of the air traffic noise & hallway noise. If you are a light sleeper this hotel may not be a good hotel for you. The furniture looks like it was updated and the bed was comfy, however the wallpaper, and fixtures are all old. The hallways have the original old carpet. Last stop at LAX I stayed at the Radisson may not be upgraded with new carpet and furniture but there was no airtraffic noise. stayed for one night before flying back to Australia. Great free shuttle that picks you up outside the airport, every 15 min. Large comfy room. There are no food places to walk too that we could see. We ordered room service, that was delicious, but not cheap! Great to have a starbucks in the foyer. Lovely hotel Horacio & the management staff make you feel at home. Everyone is so friendly and they all remember your name. In such a fast pace city this team brings a small town feel to the entire experience. I would recommend this place to everyone! A fairly typical airport hotel, efficient, clean and clynical. The lobby was freezing in December. Rooms fine and the room service food was good. Only 10 minutes by regular shuttle to LA's awful airport. My stay was great. Hotel was very nicely appointed and modern. The people were very friendly including valet’s including the people at the front desk. A very nice lady named Diane was especially friendly and made me want to come back again and stay at this hotel again.\n",
      "Thanks Diane\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel. We chose this hotel for our overnight layover at LAX during a flight to Hawaii. I have a huge fear of missing the plane on the way to our destination (not so much on the way back), so I wanted a hotel that was as close to the airport as possible. This one did not disappoint...It is almost IN the airport! We grabbed the free shuttle from LAX and were there in a few short minutes. This appears to be primarily a business hotel, as there were several companies holding seminars. The room was clean, room service was prompt and fairly good, and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is also fairly close to shopping, as we found out when my husband discovered he forgot his prescription sunglasses at home. We took a short cab ride to a shopping center in nearby Culver City and took care of that problem asap. The shuttle ride back to LAX the next morning was quick and we were back in the air in no time. We will not hesitate to chose this hotel again for an overnight at LAX. Only stayed for a one night layover, but would recommend it. Its clean and efficient and not noisy. The beds and pillows are very comfortable and the free coffee is a nice touch. The shower is great with lots of water pressure and they were generous with the amenities.\n",
      " The bar was hopping and the hotel was decorated in chic fashion for the holidays. \n",
      "The check-in was hassle free and check out was ready under the door before leaving.\n",
      "The only bummer was that the \"free wifi\" asks for 10.95 to be charged to the room. Lame! Mr. Washington\n",
      "Fantastic service,\n",
      "I would like to command Estela Estrada she went above and beyond with service very attentive the food was excellent,\n",
      "her service was great I did not have to ask twice for anything always there to serv.\n",
      "Thank you and thank Estela for me. I got this hotel through Hotwire, choosing a 4 star hotel at LAX. It cost $95 per night. I really wasn't sure what I was in for so only booked one room for the 4 of us. I was able to choose 2 queen beds. When I got told the name of the hotel after booking I was a bit disappointed because this is really not a 4 star hotel according to Tripadvisor . However, I have to say that we were very pleasantly surprised when we actually got there - and I am usually really picky about hotels!! For a start, we caught the free shuttle from just outside the arrivals lounge at LAX - red stop. We only had to wait about 5 minutes which was great after a very long flight from OZ. It only took a few minutes to get to the hotel. Check-in was great, all the staff there were really very nice and helpful. As I had asked for an early check-in our room was ready to go at 10 a.m.!!! This was so great because we were very tired after not sleeping for over 24 hrs. The room itself was really nice - as is the entire hotel. Not super large but large enough for the 4 of us and 4 enormous suitcases. The bathroom is a little on the small side but good enough - with a good shower with nice hot water that doesn't run out. The beds are extremely comfortable. There is no fridge in the room but a coffee machine was there. Also, no safe in the room but provided at the lobby. Breakfast at the restaurant cost $18 per person plus tax for a full breakfast buffet - which my family really enjoyed. There is also a restaurant for dinner which we didn't use and a bar which offers meals. We did have burgers here one night and it wasn't bad at all - cost about $15 per person. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby but we did not use this. There are no other restaurants nearby. I did see a Hungry Jacks a few blocks away. For the tourists, there is an Ocean Trolley stop at the front of the hotel which takes you to Manhattan Beach and two shopping centres for only $5. This was a great ride - even if you don't get off. Really worth doing - highly recommend it. We also did a day tour of LA with Starline Tours which picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. I'll do a separate review of this. The hotel also has a great (all new) gym which we enjoyed using and a heated pool which we ran out of time to use. Overall, this is a great hotel - especially for a short stay - not super luxurious (not like the Versace on the Gold Coast) but really very nice and very comfortable. The hotel has recently been refurbished and you can tell this – all new carpets, furniture and wall paper. The hotel did have a business centre in the lobby with free internet and free computers with printers to use - this was great. There is no free internet in the rooms however. One other important thing, there was no noise from the airport despite being just next door. Just to finish off, check out was a breeze and we only waited for a very short time for the free shuttle to take us back to LAX. If you are only in LA for a few nights, it’s really worth staying near LAX and doing tours from there. My family were all very happy to have stayed at this hotel and don't have any regrets or complaints - and I am sure that most people will agree with me. Enjoyed all the amenities of this hotel, from check in to breakfast the next morning. The service in the hotel was excellent. They have a very nice lobby bar which served great drinks and food. I especially appreciated Diane in guest services who was friendly and went out of her way to assist me. Give her a raise!!! I would recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to LA and would definately stay here again. I normally stay at Sheraton brand hotels because they usually have exceptional guest service and this hotel was no exception. Check in was easy and check in attendant was friendly. The food in the hotel was so good! A little pricey, but that is to be expected at a hotel. We ordered food from the bar (calamari and salad), the balsamic romaine salad was one of the best I\"ve had. Also ordered pizza from room service which my boyfriend said was really good and I could tell he enjoyed it because he ate the entire thing. We also had lunch at the Brasserie, had a club sandwich and a salad which were also delicious. \n",
      "Parking was pretty cheap for being in the Los angeles area, about $12-13 dollars for the entire day with in and out privileges. Internet service was $11 which I thought was a bit pricey but we purchased anyways.\n",
      "The layout of the bar was probably one of my favorite things of the hotel. Lots of places to sit and tv's on each side of the bar to watch sports. Now, for the bad part...there were two bartenders when we were at the bar, and the older one was friendly and funny and took good care of us. However, the other bartender was really rude. He didn't make our drink correctly and when we politely asked if we could order something else instead because, he seemed to get angry and showed his irritation. We even saw him complain to the other bartender about us which I thought was very unprofessional. The only other negative thing, besides the bartender, would be the cleanliness of the bathrooms. There was a large dark brown spot/smudge (not sure what it was, nor do I want to know) at the base of the toilet and the shower. \n",
      "However, the guest service was so great, I would definately recommend this hotel. Our television didn't work, and witin 3 minutes, they had someone up to fix it. They also had someone deliver a room service menu within 3 minutes when we called and asked for one. The room service attendant who brought us our room was soo friendly and gracious. The check out was quick and he was also very friendly and seemed to genuinely care that our stay was good. We had a 300 people event in the Grand Ballroom. Prior to the event we had a food tasting and et ESTELA ESTREDA who served us. She was so attentive that we requested her for our actual day of event. The day before the event we went to set up and Estela was there. Once again she made sure we had everything and more that we needed. She makes everyone feel special and you know that you can depend on her. I am asking that the management of the hotel please acknowledge her excellent service. Thank you. Just wanted to mention I booked the Sheraton Gateway on West Century in LA this past week. I was new to town and had a lot of questions. Everytime I called the internal hotel phone it seems I was connected to DIANE. She was diligent, had great follow through and best of all knew how to help me. \n",
      "Diane made my stay extra special. \n",
      "Susan from NJ I've stayed here a few times while on layovers at LAX. Every time, the level of customer service, room amenities and facilities are consistent and great value for your money. As an SPG Gold Member, the staff has always been professional and recognized my loyalty to the SPG brand. The first time I stayed here, I was upgraded to an enormous suite with a number of great amenities (especially for an airport hotel!!) and a 180 degree view of the runways -- and I love to watch the planes take-off. This large feature rich and well kept hotel surprised me being so near to LAX. There are a number of hotels near the airport but most of them are budget while the gateway keeps a metropolitan luxury feel in an area where the super 8 and extended stay facilities get the majority of the attention. \n",
      "I arrived at well near 11pm and was surprised to see and be greater by multiple desk staff after a short wait in the line.\n",
      "The suite I stayed in had a large, very comfortable bed and generous workspace and was super clean and well lit with several options for overall light or sectioned areas for more a more intimate feel. There was even a seating area good for upto 8 people.\n",
      "The one thing i didn't like is having to pay $20/day for sub par wireless Internet service and its only good for one device. There was a direct line at my desk but the front desk tells me these are disabled, which i think is a mistake.\n",
      "I had some appetizers after my all day meetings and I have to say that the quessadillas were a welcome treat and the portions were generous to boot.\n",
      "I look forward to having time for brunch in my next stay. I hear its amazing. Stayed here for two nights for a conference. In most respects it is your typical conference hotel. The hotel is a bit bland perhaps, but overall it was a positive experience. The staff stood out as being especially friendly and professional. And I have to say the buffet breakfast was easily the best I've ever had in a hotel. The selection was just outstanding, from fresh fruits to eggs, sausage, oatmeal, grits, pancakes, cereals, pastries, in addition to more unusual choices like salmon and hot blueberry crepes. All of it delicious! So if you like to start your day with a big hearty breakfast, this may be just the place for you. I had one dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant and it was very good as well. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. In my experience, airport hotels tend to be utilitarian and devoid of personality, but this one seemed to be striving to offer more than that. The lobby was stylishly decorated and had a lively-looking bar (I was way too tired to go for a drink, but I'm sure it would have been a fun place to get a cocktail). The \"business center\" (really an open area in the lobby) offered free internet access, which I appreciated. As for the rooms, they're nothing special but are clean and perfectly adequate. This would be my choice for a hotel near LAX. We have stayed here before. It's noisy and chaotic. Music blasts outside at the entry, and different music blasts at you in the lobby. They are still working on their wifi in the rooms, so it takes awhile to get connected. The breakfast staff is well intentioned by slow and careless and the food is very expensive. There is a $$$ parking charge.The lighting in the rooms is terrible and the described sitting area is an upholstered chair crammed in next to the bed. There are few towels in the rooms. The bedside lamp kept going out so we asked for another one. One maintenance person came up, took a look. He went away and another maintenance person brought us a desk lamp. After 3 attempts, we got another desk lamp.\n",
      "It's a tired old hotel and we will seek another on our visit next month. Booked the room for my husband was flew into L.A. to pickup his dad and drive him back to WA State. We had contacted the hotel staff the day prior to arrival to make sure dad could get into the room and that any 'incidentals' would be charged on our credit card. The over-the-phone staff was great and we gave them our card info so dad would have no hassles..BUT he arrived in the early afternoon and although he was let into the room, he had to give them His card and they placed a $75 'incidentals' charge on it, which made him a bit nervous. This is exactly what we wanted to avoid, so giving our card to the staff was useless. Dad is not a traveler and this is a big hotel; a bit overwhelming for him. We booked it on Hotwire for a great deal - except you don't find out about Extra Costs, until the hotel is revealed when booking through Hotwire. You only know you're getting a 4 star and the general location. Food is expensive and parking is $13.00.\n",
      "This is a beautiful hotel, but very big and busy. Still, we'd recommend staying here, with a warning about extra costs. Our recent sales meeting was a great success, internally we are aligned & the team enjoyed the location. I am alway's skeptical about utilising airport hotels, though this one exceeded my expectation. The quality of the catering, the spacious meeting room & quality of hotel rooms made for a great meeting. Estela Estrada was excellent in providing top level service to me & the team. My wife and I stayed overnight here before our trip to Vegas the next day. The staff were friendly, our room was available before the check-in time and it was a great start to our holiday.\n",
      "PROS\n",
      "Location - The hotel is located about 5-10 minutes from LAX\n",
      "Free WiFi - Note though that iPhones, iPods, iPads, PDAs and smartphones have problems connecting to the WiFi in-room\n",
      "If you can score a room with complimentary buffet, take it, it's worth it\n",
      "Free shuttle to and from LAX\n",
      "Trolley service to and from Manhattan Beach shops and pier\n",
      "CONS\n",
      "WiFi - see PROS Stayed for 4 days as I was spending most of our time in Santa Monica and Venice and was a satisfied customer when all is said and done.\n",
      "Pros: Despite it's close proximity to the airport, the rooms are very quiet and not affected by nearby aircraft. Self parking is reasonably priced at ~$13 (tax incl). While not close to downtown LA, it is very close to all the beaches while being much more affordable than the hotels that are by the beaches. Starbucks downstairs is very handy to have and the restaurant serves a nice breakfast buffet but I would not describe the pricing as fair (not worth $19).\n",
      "Cons: Rooms are a bit on the old side particularly the bathroom although the furniture is fairly new. Wifi costs money. \n",
      "I'd stay again if I were looking to visit the beaches - next to Disney, the beaches are the best thing about LA. It is a nice hotel to stay for transit. Take a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. Taxi will cost $ 17,5. The room is quite nice.The hotel charges $ 4 for delivery service for room service beside tax. And avoid to use hotel phone, very expensive. They charge for provider that wasn't mentioned in the note. The swimming pool is attractive.\n",
      "The breakfast is average, $ 22,5. Have a comfort lobby to wait. The shuttle bus driver helpful to look after our suitcases. \n",
      "There is car park beside the hotel which cost $ 15/ day than valet park that cost $ 24. There is Subway burger at the next building as the hotel burger cost $ 25 with a glass of lemon water. We returned to this site as we had a previous meeting in April. As usual the Banquet staff was attentive to all of our needs. Estela Estrada was extremely helpful with making last minute changes and making sure that all my needs were met. I would highly recommend this hotel for meetings, as the space is great and the closeness to LAX makes it easy on our nation-wide field staff! Stayed at this hotel due to a flight disruption. Checked in at 1.00am. The room we got was on Level 15 and it was quite impressive. \n",
      "Only problem was that when I tried to sleep something bit my ankles in the bed making them very itchy. In the morning I found 3 small bites/red marks on my ankles. Not sure if it was's fleas or bed bugs?! Mentioned this to the front desk and their only response was 'oh sorry to hear that'. What the??!!!\n",
      "When we woke up, we were amazed with the view and proximity to the airport. My young son was in total awe. We had to stand at the end of the corridor where there is a large curved window, and watch planes take off and land! \n",
      "The food at the restaurant was quite expensive compared to other LAX airport hotels that we had stayed at during the same trip. Highly recommend the Sheraton Four Points over this hotel - so much more child friendly with great food. This hotel is incredibly easy to find and conveniently located near LAX. Having said that, this airport has a little bit more style than your typical airport hotel. I'm thinking of the bar and the pool in particular. The pool area has some nice poolside cabanas (like the kind you'd find at some resort hotels) and the bar (and its unobtrusive soundtrack pumping through the sound system) was chic, considering that the hotel is geared toward business/travel. And, yes, there is a conference space attached to the hotel. \n",
      "The non-valet parking is behind the hotel and across the street. You have to roll your luggage about half a block to get from the parking lot to the nearest hotel entrance. It's doable and not a problem if you have light luggage or luggage on wheels. \n",
      "Once you get into the guest room it's business as usual. The accommodations are nice, clean, fairly modern, and comfortable. The room was very nice, it just wasn't over-the-top luxurious. But it's not a resort so what do you expect? Having said that, this place does spoil you. For anyone spending a short time in LA (e.g. overnight layover) this place could possibly trick your brain into thinking you were on a mini-mini-mini vacation. \n",
      "If you have a car, even better. Check out the beaches that are not far away. I can't say much about the immediate area surrounding the hotel. It's mostly car rental places, other hotels, the airport, fast food, etc. Staying in LA for a long term assignment, the staff and management at this Sheraton go out of their way to make the it a personal experience. In a high traffic area, they take the time to find out what you need to reduce the stress of travel and the anxiety of the unknown. It is common to be addressed by name, whether by the personable housecleaning staff, the bellmen, or the restaurant and facilities managers. \n",
      "There is an esprit among the staff that makes what could easily be a cold, impersonal business arrangement into a community event if not a party. For a hotel close to LAX this is the perfect choice. Couldn't fault anything and there was a Starbucks in the lobby (could get my latte at 6am...jetlagged!) and a Subway 2mins walk away. Easy overnight option for a family. We used this hotel for our stop overs on a recent holiday to Hawaii and as we'd stayed here before we knew what to expect. The hotel rooms do look a little tired, as do the bathrooms, but the beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. Also the free shuttle bus is a bonus at the airport.\n",
      "The staff were really helpful in giving us an extended check-out time so we could go shopping without worrying about our bags and still shower before our flight home. I'm not sure I'd rate the buffet breakfast though. It wasn't a patch on the one we had in Honolulu (also a Sheraton). \n",
      "We also managed to get a bus to Third Street Promenade this time rather than a taxi which was much cheaper and hassle-free, so definitely ask the concierge about this. We stayed here twice on our recent trip to the US - 3 nights inbound and 1 night prior to our departure. As always the staff were friendly and very accomodating. The rooms are clean and spacious and the beds very comfortable (although I'm not a big fan of their pillows - or any pillow at any hotel we stayed at on this trip!) The curtains are thick allowing for decent sleep to fight off the jet lag. The bathroom is a dated but kept clean. On each floor is an ice machine and a pepsi machine. Newspapers are delivered to the room each day. On stays more than a day you can elect not to have your room made up and as an incentive you are given a voucher for $5 to spend at the hotel. Starbucks accepts the voucher which with a little extra money chipped in makes for a cheap breakfast. The shuttle bus to the airport is easy to use and we never had to wait long.\n",
      " At the back of the hotle is a parking area. To the right of the parking area is a 'gift shop'. It looks like it is in a shed but inside is a great little store with drinks, food and some handy supplies. We have stayed in this hotel twice before this time and never found this place! \n",
      "If you walk through the carpark you hit the LAX bus terminal (5 minute walk from the hotel). From there you can catch a bus to just about any where. We got the bus to Santa Monica and back for under $4. The buses run regularly and we found them very easy to navigate. \n",
      "On Wednesday nights the staff run a wii tournament. It is free and all you do is sign up and have a go. They provide free nibblies (spring rolls, wings and fresh vegetables) and drinks. We didnt eat at the hotel (other than starbucks) as it was a little expensive. We went to subway (right next door) and twice the hotel staff provided us with menus and a phone and we ordered pizza to the room. A pepperoni pizza delivered with plates and a tip was around $14. Staff also gave us a late check out when we had a late flight home. The lobby had free wifi and there was a couple of computers near the bar that you could use.\n",
      "Overall a great stay - on our last day at the hotel there was a very large convention but the staff were fantastic in still assisting others when the hotel was incredibly busy. We stayed here for 1 night prior to a flight out of LAX. I won't stay anywhere else again -- this hotel was just fine. Typical Sheraton, nice rooms and nice hotel. We took the free shuttle to the airport the next morning. Reasonable rate for the rooms. We didn't want to order room service so we had a pizza delivered from a local company. No complaints, good hotel! I had high expectations, given the reviews, but was generally disappointed. I arrived later in the evening and the hotel lobby and check-in area was packed. I sat down in the bar area to have a late dinner (the restaurant was closed) and could not get any service because there were so many people and so few workers. I decided to go order room service. Though the room service menu indicated delivery was guaranteed to be 30 minutes or less or the food would be free, the operator told me it would take an hour because \"they just dropped a 747 of passengers from Australia at our door.\" Delivery took somewhere around 40 to 45 minutes or more. (It doesn't sound like much but it is a long time when you had a long travel day and feel like eating and going to bed.) The food (a pizza) was mediocre and somewhat expensive. The room had a very odd odor to it that never went away. Parking was inconvenient. The fitness room was nice but did not have fresh water like most nicer hotels (only a public drinking fountain). The water in the shower took several minutes to warm. The hotel restaurant had mediocre food and was expensive. The hotel was not terrible and the location was very close to the airport but there were too many small problems. Overall, there are just too many other options to return here again. We needed a clean, safe, convenient overnight stay close to LAX for a low cost. Through a priceline bid, we got a great rate ($73) for 1 night.\n",
      "The lobby was nice and upscale, the valet and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The room appeared to have had a partial update (thus the botox facelift reference). The bathroom was older than I am, and didn't appear that clean. I wouldn't rate the hotel as a 4star establishment, however I would gladly give it 3 bright stars.\n",
      "We ordered from room service (a Sheraton club sandwich). The food was very tasty, albeit very expensive - but what does one expect in LA and from room service. $30 later, our sandwich, fries and cranberry juice had satiated our late night travel hunger.\n",
      "We awoke to a bit of an issue with an infant spiking a high0grade fever. The front desk staff were extremely helpful in directing us to the Concentra urgent care clinic (right next door) and followed up with us to make certain everything was okay (it was!). \n",
      "Overall, we were quite pleased with the stay. If we had paid full price, the review might be slightly different, but at under $100 for the night, we were happy.\n",
      "- A few things to know - valet parking is $24/night. There is a garage nearby, but I was too tired to deal with that. \n",
      "- My husband was approached by two working girls outside the lobby, but this didn't make us feel any less safe. The neighborhood seemed fine.\n",
      "- This seems to be a stay-over hotel for airline crews. As there were a lot of pilots and attendants. This can sometimes be a sign of a good place to stay.\n",
      "- We didn't take the shuttle, but did see a BIG line in the morning waiting for the shuttle. So I would suggest planning to take an early shuttle.\n",
      "- Starbucks onsite. Slow, but caffeinated. I was there for a business event and the banquet staff was extremely attentive and helpful. If I could name the two that stood out the most it would be Estele and Billy the Manager. They both were so attentive to what we needed and were always there attentive and ready. Estele was such a delight to have around our event. She was so helpful. \n",
      "Thank you banquet staff and a great thanks to Estele and Billy. First, I have to give credit to Sharon Yau for helping me with reservations. Second, bartender Greg took very good care of us while we had a girl's night out. The way of servicer and politeness was extremely good. Boys at valet did also a good job :) As a disclaimer, my view/experience at this hotel may be biased a little by the fact that I had just spent 2 weeks in Australia at not-so-hot hotels, but either way it was a really really nice hotel. Our stay was via a priceline confirmation @ 69/night and it was money spent well.\n",
      "#1 thing that made this hotel so awesome was the fact that we arrived from an 14 hour international flight at 8:30am and the sweet young lady at the front desk went ahead and let us check in to our rooms instead of having to wait until their usual 2-3:00pm check-in time. I was so happy I could have kissed her! So for that alone they get extra brownie points. I would give her a shout-out here but unfortunately I don't recall her name.\n",
      "Secondly, the king sized beds were so comfortable and each person had two pillows without having to ask. Also, liked the fact that there was lots of layers of covers. Some times you're too hot in hotels or too cold but just have to deal with it b/c you just have a sheet or a comforter but in this hotel there were several layers to the blankets. Room was large and had access to large and wide selection of TV channels. \n",
      "We didn't notice the airport noise that much. One downfall was that it is so far away from anything else but I guess that's what you get when you stay by the airport. They do have convenient and timely shuttle service to and from the airport terminals as well as a trolley service that that can give you roundtrip service to and from the hotel and near by attractions (Manhattan Beach and a few shopping centers + maybe 1 or 2 other places I can't remember) for $5/pp for those who don't have a car and don't wish to rent one. \n",
      "I did not try their pool or gym although both looked impressive. Did use their internet in the business center for a whopping $8/15 mins once to book a few things and confirm airline reservations. Housekeeping was good and hotel over all was very very clean. \n",
      "We got directions on how to take the public bus to Santa Monica Beach from the concierge who was helpful and gave us instructions on where the bus stop is (across the street from the pay car lot behind the hotel) and told us which bus to get on. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning - breakfast was a little pricey but that's expected for hotel restaurants. The buffet didn't seem to have that many options other than fruit and oatmeal/cereals/breads. Walked down to Denny's (15min walk) for the other morning breakfasts. \n",
      "Doubt I'll ever be in this area again but if I ever find myself needing a good nights sleep near LAX I'll definitely know where to go. Only thing I would have like to of seen in the hotel room that we didn't have was maybe a mini-fridge. Otherwise, awesome stay here, 100%. My company had a couple of events this past weekend here @ the Sheraton. As the event coordinator, I have to say the meeting rooms were equipped as needed, the food was wonderful, the beds were extremeley comfortable, all of the rooms were very clean and the hotel staff went above and beyond. \n",
      "I personally want to commend both Billy Cubillas and Agustin Ortega (hotel staff) for an outstanding job. They were there when I needed them, they checked in with me from time to time, they were polite, professional and so very kind! One can only hope that ALL of the world's customer service was like what these two gentleman performed. Without both of them and their employees, this wouldn't have gone as smooth and without a hitch. So, again I thank you for your efforts and dedication. You deserve a pat on the back! I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights and paid 106 total with all taxes per night. For this rate this hotel is unbeatable. It has 820 rooms, a pool, and all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. It is located 5 mins to LAX. I’ll start with the negative since I only have a couple. The shuttle service is extremely slow and you will wait for almost half an hour when they say it is only 15 mins. So make sure you allocate enough time when you rely on this shuttle service. I wouldnt bother with valet service as they are soooooo slow and I feel are inefficient. Just park in the lot behind the hotel on 98th stree for $13 in and out priviledges. \n",
      "Service – this is what makes this hotel shine especially the guest services folks nothing is too much to ask, if they can do it they will accommodate you. I especially want to mention Diane and Merlie Pickett, these two ladies provided me with the best service during my stay. I even stopped by to meet them in person. They go above and beyond. \n",
      "Rooms – they are very clean and well appointed, modern décor and oh so comfortable beds. It is very clean and the soundproofing is very adequate. I am a very light sleeper and I did not have any problems whatsoever. This hotel is along century blvd but they have rooms that are facing 98th street where the parking lots are located this is the quiet side. Housekeeping never forgets to clean up the room even when I ask them to clean it up later in the afternoon. The room doesn’t come with a safe. It also doesn’t come with a refrigerator unless you request one and they would charge you for it. \n",
      "Even if the location of this hotel is by the airport if you have a car you can go to so many areas around it. Manhattan beach is 15 mins away and so is Marina del rey. If you plan to rent a car go with midway rental which is 2 blocks from this hotel, I had the best rate with that company although the battery died on the car on my last day. If you go left or right on Sepulveda blvd theres a lot of grocery, estabilishments etc\n",
      "I would definitely stay in this hotel again only if the price is around 150. You can get this through hotwire. Im not sure if I would pay more than 200 for this hotel. \n",
      "If you are looking for a hotel to WOW you this is not the one, if you are looking for a practical, clean, value for your money place then this is a great fit. In fact it exceeds expectations if your expectations are not that high. We traveled around California for two weeks and flew in/out or LAX. This was our first hotel and was much more enjoyable (cleaner, more modern) than the Radisson down the street (where we stayed on our way out). The service at the front desk, concierge, bar and valet was always good and efficient. Valet parking is a bit expensive, but at least there's free wi-fi in the common areas.\n",
      "Next time we would probably stay in Santa Monica or the Hollywood area instead of using LAX as a home base. That said, this is a very good airport hotel. I appreciate the special serive of associate Estela Estrade who served our team the entire stay (3 days). She was most gracious and the food service was exceptional. Estela gave careful attention to our needs. She had such a pleasant disposition which made our work environment very warm and manageable. \n",
      "Thank you Estela. We needed a place near LAX for travel from Boston MA to Sydney Australia. This hotel features a shuttle and we never waited more than 5 minutes on either end. We arrived about 11PM and were very pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the room. Decor was top scale modern. We had breakfast in the restaurant and were again quite taken by the quality of the meal. My partner had the buffet and I had the smoked salmon plate. The service was attentive and charming. The concierge was helpful in pointing out the free shuttle to nearby Manhattan Beach, so we spent the day shopping and dining there. The hotel stored our luggage after we checked out for free. Upon returning, we had a cocktail in the humming bar before setting off on the convenient shuttle back to the airport. This place is not recommended for the budget minded, but if you are looking for a great place to lay over, this is it. I had stayed here a few years ago and the place felt dingy so I had struck it off my list. Stayed there recently and found the hotel superb. Great service, nice lobby and great restaurants as well as Starbucks in the lobby. Definitely plan to return and make this my place to stay if I need to be close to LAX. After an awesome Vegas trip, we decided to fly to LA for a couple of days before heading back home. My biggest concern was finding a hotel near LAX that would be just awesome experience after a full day of activities with good value. After searching for hotels and reading reviews on TripAdvisor, we decided on Sheraton Gateway LAX we were so satisfied. We arrived earlier than check-in and we were immediately accommodated. Exceptional service, our room was so clean and fresh. They are not run-down rooms, they are spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom had clean, white towels, and our rooms were refreshed upon request. No problems there. We were not bothered by housekeeping to hurry out. The hotel has a convenient Starbucks inside so you can catch breakfast (oatmeal/pastry/coffee) on your way out if you prefer something quick. I loved having Starbucks inside the hotel! Parking is expensive, but there is a parking lot behind the hotel that offers parking for the Hotel guests for half the price, $13 a day, unlimited. \n",
      "There is a California Pizza Kitchen across the hotel. I do not recommend going to the Burger King a few blocks from the hotel. Bad service and bad food. EWWW!\n",
      "Other than that, the Sheraton hotel was great. No complaints. I will definitely stay there again. \n",
      "It was also great because Budget Rent-A-Car was just around the corner and the hotel offers free complimentary LAX 24hr shuttle. Apart from the location, there was nothing else positive.\n",
      "The carpets were dirty and torn and the food was horrible. From the moment I pulled up to the valet service, to the check-in, I felt like royalty! Sammy is always smiling and Soraida & Lissette were very helpful and efficient. Yessenia at the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable of the property. Pete, Gerardo, Yo & Giovanni were very professional and helpful. They were all smiling and looked very professional. Albert & Manny are such a great asset to the Sheraton Gateway team. Cristobal in room service was quick to deliver my order and very polite. Greg in the lobby bar can work that bar with his eyes closed and his manager Roman was very pleasant. If there's anyone that's a bigger Laker's fan that Deondrik (in Loss Prevention), I would like to meet them. All in all, my stay was very pleasant and memorable and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that's staying near the LAX area. I have stayed at many Sheraton around the world (many in the U.S, Bangkok, Stockholm, Krabi, Fiji to mention a few) and this is by far the biggest disappointment. The hotel say its has made million dollar renovation. Our room was just bad. The bathroom is OLD and small that you can barley close the door when you are inside without having to step into the bathtub! The bathroom walls where stained by old toothpaste and yellow stains. The bed where not comfy at all (new? no!) and the worst part if you take a room with a odd number then you will face the airport and you will hear plane taking off all day and night. The room walls are so thin that we heard the alarm clock go off in the next door room, the person taking a shower and singing! and from the room above we could hear every step they took. Now the price was really good but then they really whack you on the breakfast. 18 dollar for a very bad presented breakfast buffet and you have to pay extra for drinks! I have written a lot of reviews and I really can not recommend this hotel. \n",
      "The only good thing about this hotel where the bell man helping you with your luggage and the Concierge service which was very helpful and nice. We got this hotel through Hotwire. Very comfortable and clean. Regular shuttle bus service to LAX. Check in staff very helpful and friendly.\n",
      "Would definitely stay here again. Just returned from a wonderful weekend in Los Angeles. The rooms were fantastic\n",
      "and clean. The bed with plenty of pillows really helped the sleeping hours be\n",
      "more comfortable.\n",
      " I must thank several of your staff by name: Jose Chajon; Gabriela Sochinski; and Everardo Gonzalez.\n",
      "I spent most of my time at the bar area watching football games. It was pleasing to see what a true team should be as they provided outstanding service to each and every customer in a full service bar (food and drinks).\n",
      "Kudos to them and I wish them well. Look forward to visitiing Los Angeles in the future.\n",
      " Sincerely,\n",
      "SSgt Mike Perez, Air Force Reserve My husband's flight was delayed & every hotel near the LA airport was either sold out or selling high rates. I called the Sheraton Gateway and Juliet who I spoke to was very attentive, courteous and friendly. I told her my situation and she immediately spoke to her manager, Steve. I was told to come to the Front Desk and Steve will take care of the situation. I was welcomed by Whitney with a great smile who checked me in. I later called Juliet to thank her for all her assistance and she immediately told me to just relax and watch a movie without no charge. I was so amazed with everyone's anticipation of my needs. The next morning, I called the operator and spoke to Diana. OMG, the tone of her voice has so much excitement of friendliness, courteous and willing to assist. I told her that my husband's flight has been delayed again so I have to wait for another 12 hours. Diana immediately told me that she will extend my check out time to 3pm. I also told her that I left my phone charger at home and again, she told me to come down to front desk and she can find a charger that will fit my phone. She was so helpful in every situation. Diana truly an asset to your hotel. Arlene at the Front Desk was also also accommodating. The concierge are also very helpful. Overall, the whole staff are very friendly, courteous and very professional in every department they represent. I was able to afford a night stay and saved a lot of driving back and forth from LA to SD. I also had a good sleep with a very comfortable bed. Thank you. Check in was fast with courteous service, room decor is business like but upscale, my only personal thing is that the windows don't open but most hotel windows do not\n",
      "open anyway... We spent 4 wonderful days at the Sheraton Gateway L.A. Hotel. We were attending an Annual Convention of the Italian Catholic Federation.\n",
      "Everything was excellent: from the moment we checked-in at Valet Service, checked in at the desk and Mr. Giovanni F. escorted our luggage to our room....\n",
      "Our room was roomy, spotless, quiet, and comfortable...with a nice view of planes taking off. Beautiful rotating T.V.\n",
      "The corciege was most helpful with any questions we had and the maid service was proficient.\n",
      "Loved your 2 restaurants. The Hostess at the Brassiere was welcoming and we enjoyed the service of waiters Antonio and Gregorio. Especially enjoyed the eggs Benedict and the oatmeal.\n",
      "A young lady at the gift shop on Thursday evening or Friday morning was truly helpful.\n",
      "Nice products...\n",
      "What can I say about the food at The Ristorante Papparazi !\n",
      "That Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and served elegantly.The Striped Bass was tender and tasty....\n",
      "We participated in many \" convention\" activities in comfortable settings.\n",
      "We enjoyed a banquet and a dinner-dance with a Sinatra impersonator...\n",
      "This visit included work and business but also relaxation and fun...\n",
      "We would recommend The Sheraton Gateway to all our friends. I loved this Sheraton it's in the right location the bed was the best. I had Breakfast in the Brassier and there was a hosted named jasmine she was very polite and helpful. she meet all of my needs. She asked me questions for my stay which was very nice of her. the next day she was there also and i thanked her for the day before and she said if i need anything just give her a call. She was very welcoming. Housekeeping in the hall way always spoke to me as i passed. the starbucks worked very fast and making sure all the guest were served. Love the t.v.s in the bar area. Spent one night here after arriving late from Kona. The hotel was packed and almost sold out. We had two rooms (Priceline - $62 each) so I was expecting to get stuck with the worst possible rooms. The assistant manager worked very hard to get us two rooms close to one another. Finally found a second room that housekeeping needed to clean. Gave us the keys to the first room and said it would take about 15 minutes and he would have someone bring up the key to the second room. I ended up calling down to the front desk three times. One hour later, the other room was finally ready. Not a horrible thing, just wasn't great having to deal with cranky kids who wanted to go to bed. The beds were very, very comfortable. Shuttle to the airport was quick and convenient. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I stayed in the Sheraton Gateway LAX for business from 8/11-8/15, and it was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Our banquet hots Estela Estrada & Roberto Carrillo provided a great overall experience during our complex and intensive meetings. I felt as ease to know the hotel has team members such as them to ensure that our event is a success. We stayed in the Sheraton Gateway after arriving from the uk. We had had a very stressfull week as our plans had been changed thanks to an icelandic volcano. We orignally were scheduled to be staying in LA for a few days before setting off on our adventure. We had to change plans and were now looking for just somewhere to sleep before driving to Vegas. The shearton gateway was just what the doctor ordered free transfer from LAX, comfy beds, clean room and no noise (which was a suprise being so close to the airport.) We woke early, well rested and refreshed ready to pick up our car from the Hertz which is a short cab ride away. But first the breakfast we had the full breakfast included in our room rate and took advantage of it with botomless orange juice, and high quality food. We talked to other travellers who had been staying there while they waited for a flight home (again thanks to the volcano,) they said the quality of the Sheraton Gateway was the only thing keeping them going.\n",
      "Very good value for money if your looking for a stop over. I want to recognize Jose (Eng) as a very kind and courteous maintenance employee at your hotel. There was a sound of running water in my room. As soon as he came in he knew what the issue was and how to fix it. He was very kind to me and apologized for any inconvenience. He made a difference. Thank you. Sheraton LAX hotel had poor service overall, especially poor housekeeping service on the day we checked in; but decent service at it's restaurant.\n",
      "Too pricey for the quality of the rooms we stayed in. It appears that if we prepay from the Sheraton website, we get the best rate, but also will be given the most worn out rooms, with shabby bathrooms. Between the two rooms we reserved, the A/C was noisy/clanky, one phone did not work, one coffee maker did not work, one of the bathrooms (tiny anyway) was not clean when we checked in (had the previous guest's hair and toileteries in the shower), housekeeping did not arrive to clean bathroom even after waiting an hour after checking in, we changed rooms, but the bathrooms have dirty corners, wallpaper is peeling off, and tubs are choked and slow running. If I stay here again (impossible), I'll bring a bottle of Drano along. The 9th floor should be avoided, its kept for hotel guests who prepay. Will not return here ever. Even with prepay, the Sheraton rate was $120 a night (with tax). Did not include parking ($25 extra per day), no free Internet access in rooms, no included breakfast. Absolutely no value for money. We stayed at a nearby Hilton on our way back, we had a pleasant stay at the Hilton. No more Sheratons, first stay was my last stay. I'm a big fan of the Sheraton LAX for a handful of reasons. Obviously this is not the best hotel in the Los Angeles area, but it's a good place to stay if you're between flights or getting ready to depart on an exciting international adventure.\n",
      "I've also had the pleasure to attend a business conference in the meeting rooms area of Sheraton LAX and also enjoyed that part of the hotel. The meeting rooms are quite spacious and nicely furnished for a comfortable seminar experience.\n",
      "My absolute favorite part of Sheraton LAX is the breakfast. Enjoy the scrambled eggs and toast American breakfast delivered straight to your room at your appointed hour. (I must admit I'm a bit of a sucker for breakfast-in-bed room service at Sheraton hotels. But this one is a cut above the rest.)\n",
      "Only problem with this hotel is sometimes the prices are a bit up and down. Be sure to book early and don't even think about the other hotels nearby. You're going to pay an arm and a leg for not nearly the same caliber of services. Just stick with the old-standby Sheraton LAX. I stay here more than my home over the last 2 years. The room service staff is great. Example Just ordered room service and forgot to ask for Tobasco. Americo (Name of server) remember for me.\n",
      "Thanks Guys! A remarkably nice superior room provides the best value at LAX for tourists or transit passengers alike. Four star room service plus big screen TV, chocolate coins on pillow and a price that will not kill your budget. Be smart, rent a car and do not stay in Beverly Hills and waste money for a lesser room. We had a great nights stay at this hotel which we got good deal on through Hotwire. So pluss for value (with our deal), nice pool area with a very varm svimming pool and a hot bubble bath, huge fitness room, and rooms that are just what you expect from a four star business hotel. \n",
      "Minus for 10 dollars for WIFI (per unit), and valet parking only that will rip the budget minded traveller off by 24 dollars. Don´t try to fool them by self parking on their lot, because they will fine you. But you can outsmart them by parking by the public road on the back side of the hotel for free. It is unristricted between midnight and 8 AM or else 2 hours max. Even better, behind the airport pakring lot by that road (where you can save half of what Sheraton is charging you) there is free parking the whole day through on the street next to Burger King a short 5 mins walk from the hotel.\n",
      "This is the closest you can get to the airport, which is nice if you are in a hurry, but not so nice if you are a light sleeper. It is a short drive on highway 1 to Venice beach and Santa Monica which is great if you use it as a base for vacation. Westfield Mall is a 10 min drive north on 405. Hollywood, Universal studios and Downtown could take a while depending on traffic. I recently spent one night at the Sheraton Gateway prior to a morning flight out of LAX. I selected it mainly because of price (I got an excellent rate on Expedia) and also because of its proximity to the airport and the free shuttle bus. I was really pleased with the hotel – check in was quick and efficient, the room was lovely and spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable! The bathroom was clean but a bit tired and dated – definitely in need of a refurbishment. The shower wasn’t the best but it did the job. All members of the hotel staff I came across were courteous, polite and helpful and the shuttle bus got us to the airport in no time at all. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the hotel and, should I ever find myself in need of a hotel at LAX in the future, I wouldn’t hesitate to book the Sheraton Gateway. The Sheraton Gateway LAX is ideal for a visit to LA. Though you would have to have a car. It is very close to the airport and the shuttle gets you there very quickly meaning if you are transatlantic it is easy to wait till the next day to pick up your car from the very local car hire depots. \n",
      "I don't think many people realise when choosing an LA hotel that this is remarkably near to the beach. There are great beaches the other side of the airport and just 10 minutes drive away is the nice small resort of Manhattan Beach with its restaurants and general seaside ambience. \n",
      "The rooms are large and a good standard of accommodation. The pool is nicely set for an airport hotel and the lobby with free wifi is spacious and comfortable. \n",
      "Bear in mind that there is always a cost to park when at LAX airports. However there is a large local car park next to the hotel, where for about $13 inc tax Sheraton guests can get a 24 hour stay with in and out privileges. Factor this cost into the price when deciding. \n",
      "I would certainly recommend this hotel and would use it again myself. I wanted to take my partner for a weekend getaway. We wanted to go somewhere that provided an excellent value while still being conveniently located and comfortable. Watching the planes land and take off at LAX provided an excellent and scenic backdrop to our weekend away from home. The service staff were friendly and professional, the bar and lounge areas were quite neat and the food at the restaurant matched our tastes. I would highly recommend this hotel. You get done meeting with clients and finally get back to the hotel and all you want is a nice dinner. I was worried when the Shula's was replaced by Paparazzi but let not your heart be troubled. I had a great dining experience at the bar in Paparazzi. They had the entire dinner menu available...which was very good quality, and the bartenders (Horacio and Kerri) made the evening very enjoyable. I don't mind eating solo nearly as much with a great bar and good menu. Thanks to Horacio and Kerri for back-to-back great dining experiences. We were travelling on our way back to NZ from Europe, and decided to break our journey for one night in Los Angeles. We booked the Sheraton Gateway online, and when we booked in they upgraded us to the club floor. This really made our journey home more enjoyable, as we were tired and jet lagged. We especially liked the breakfast in the club lounge, and there was no problem in selecting what you wanted and taking it back to the room. We had a few drinks during their happy hour 4-6 pm, and the staff were all very courteous and helpful. As we had the day to fill in, we caught the trolley to Manhatten Beach for lunch, then stopped off a shopping mall on our way home. The hotel stored our luggage, and it was a very nice, stress free stay. Would thoroughly recommend and will definitely stay there again. We arrived very late from the east coast and just needed someplace to lay our heads before going on to San Diego in the morning. Checkin personnel were abrupt to the point of being rude. Room was adequate. This is an airport hotel and I have never paid for parking at an airport hotel even at JFK, but they make you pay throught the nose here. I don't remember if the internet was free. They have a big TV and smaller ones in the lobby bar where we watched the World Cup. Overall, just an ok stay for the price- I'd look elsewhere next time. Considering the issue with parking, I should rate this hotel as poor or terrible. I had originally booked at the other Sheraton -- the Four Points -- but poor reviews caused me to switch to this hotel, and it was less expensive than either the highly rated Radisson or the Hilton. I don't remember anything particularly special about this hotel or my stay -- check-in went quickly, the staff was efficient but not overly friendly thus \"professioinal\" and my room was attractive and clean. And very close to the airport! So for a place to sleep it was fine. The Starbuck's in the lobby was closed when I checked out, but my friend ordered really expenisve room service which came quickly and was (according to him) okay tasting. My big complaint was parking. I had rented a car, and when I pulled up to ask the valet where the parking lot was, he said there wasn't one and only valet parking was available. I think I was scammed. Later I saw a pay lot behind the hotel. What gives with that? At least the valet in the morning was quick to retrieve my car and was good with my parking it in front for a while. I guess people at an airport hotel don't drive? He should have at least given me the options. We spent one night on our way from Australia to Washington DC. Service was great - check-in was fast. Rooms were refurbished and stylish except the bathrooms looked old and our shower drain wasn't great. However, bed was super comfy. Pool is smaller than the photo and the lobby is chaos with the number of people! We got a good rate so very happy with the stopover. There is free wifi in the lobby but not in the rooms. I am not that picky, I stay in 30+ hotels a yr but when the bottle of water they charge $5 for is half full, your remote looks like it joined the previous guest in a pizza fight, the water pressure is akin to a drip, the hotel feels dreary and you paid $200+ to be staying on the SPG floor, you surely never stay there again or recommend anyone else does. The only property in the SPG network above $200 per that has dirtier rooms than this property is the Westin Charlotte. Recently, I stayed overnight at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel for the first time in Los Angeles. Rheziel Sena went out of her way to help me with directions and information regarding food establishments. She smiled during the entire conversation and wrote down pertinent information to help me. She stayed calm even though I was very tense. I came away thinking, \"Wow, she is so kind and caring.!\" I am an SPG gold member and often stay at this hotel when in LA. Absolutely one of my favorites. Rafael at the front desk was great. Pool is awesome. Valet is pricey, but convenient. I think it is $24 a day. Self Parking is $15. Starbucks in lobby, thats if you need to go down there.Because starbucks cofee is also in the room.Have stayed at this hotel approximately 6 or 7 times and have always ejoyed my stay. Great staff, all of them. Free wifi for SPG gold & Platinum members. Nice gym area. And thats all i can think of. We wanted a hotel that was close to the airport but good value for money the last night of our holiday. Went middle of the road with a club room which we thought offered us a decent room and access to a club lounge with free drinks in the evening. The room was ok. The only thing in the bathroom was soap, shampoo and cream rinse. Not good for a club room, you even had to ring housekeeping if you wanted a shower cap. Soft drinks only free in the club lounge everything else on honor bar (not what I found advertised). Good service in the bar/restaurant. Would not stay again. Recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX and absolutely loved it. I spent about an extra $20 on the room rate for a room on the \"Club Floor\" and I would say it was money well spent. Top floor, excellent view of arriving and departing aircraft (for people like me who love that kind of thing), free wifi and free breakfast in club lounge (which also has a great view over the airport). Very nice hotel, Paparazzi restaurant is well rated (althought I didn't eat there, I read a number of reviews) and the food in the lobby bar is good and reasonably priced. I have stayed at a number of the major hotels around LAX however this one was definitely my favorite. Very nice room and bathroom. Will definitely stay again. I stayed here two night for a conference held at the hotel. Check in was ok. No free wi-fi except in the lobby. Fortunately, my room was on a low floor and I could still pick up the signal from the lobby. If you don't want to pay for wifi, try requesting something on the 3rd or 4th floor. Walls are paper thin; I had to listen to my neighbors watching tv one night till after 1 am. My room had an odd smell to it - not offensive exactly, but not pleasant. I heard they allow pets in the room, and the smell could be pet stains covered up with cleaner. \n",
      "Nothing to brag about with the hotel really. If I needed to stay at the airport, and I got a steal, I'd stay here again. But paying $150 a night, next time I'll stay at someplace else close by and walk to the conference. Front desk agent did not smile upon arrival. Concierge was standing around looking at me with four luggages after a long flight. Several employees passed by me without saying hello! Stayed at Sheraton Gateway June 2010 with my family in order to catch early am flight out of LA. The hotel was very nice with a trendy/comtemporary vibe. The room was very tastefully decorated, clean and beds were comfortable. The hotel was quiet and we slept well. Check in/out was quick. The breakfast bar the next morning was delicious and fresh. The only thing was, I thought when I purchased the room breakfast for two was included in the price, come to find out it wasn't could of been my error not positive though, may want to watch that part b/c the breakfast bar isn't cheap. Was able to leave right on time with the shuttle service. Good - Shuttle bus (follow signs for where shuttle buses pull in) quick & efficient - will be waiting much longer for taxi at LAX.\n",
      "5 minute drive to hotel.\n",
      "Smooth check-in & out.\n",
      "Spacious room.\n",
      "Great bed.\n",
      "No airplane noise despite proximity to airport.\n",
      "Nice bar area.\n",
      "Starbucks in lobby.\n",
      "Very helpful staff.\n",
      "Bad - Restaurant closed on Sundays\n",
      "Tip: paid $38 for taxi from hotel to Santa Monica. Got taxi back & driver tried to charge us $65 (had sticker on dashboard of his car saying Santa-monica to LAX is $52 & we hadn't even gone as far as airport!!). So I told him I was not willing to pay a cent more than $52. Helpful hotel staff advised taxi driver that usually taxi from hotel to Santa Monica cost $45. Don't allow yourself to be ripped off. We checked in late on a Friday and were meeting friends in the morning to drive to Santa Barbara and this hotel was perfect for us. The shuttle from LAX was quick, check-in was a breeze and the rooms were large, clean and very comfortable. For $109 it really is a great deal! Sheraton Gateway looks beautiful and elegant in the lobby areas with the use of dark neutral tones. They tried to replicate this in the rooms, which also had the dark neutral tones. However, the renovations look like they were done on the cheap as the fittings were of a poor quality. One of the lamps in the room didn't work and the basin tap handles felt wobbly. The bath/shower also looked old. The room we were put in had mould in the bathroom, which I do not like. \n",
      "The other disadvantage also is that it appears they allow dogs in the hotel. I saw two dogs in the lobby area, though fortunately none on my floor; I don't like dogs and I don't like their smell. However, the carpets on our floor show signs of dog droppings being rubbed off. \n",
      "I also caution that if you need to use the phone, read the guest service booklet. We were slugged a $38 telephone charge for calling a cell phone in Los Angeles; I was only on the phone for about 6 minutes. And, I know it is an airport hotel and therefore some air traffic noise is unavoidable, but I have stayed in airport hotels (such as the Hampton Inn Charlotte Airport) where I didn't notice the noise of planes taking off and landing. \n",
      "Having said all that, they had late check-outs and free wireless internet for SPG members, which I am and which we used, and the shuttle to the airport was hassle free. They showed up regularly. It is also within walking distance to an In and Out, which makes the best burger in Los Angeles.\n",
      "For a short stop over (one or two nights), it is a convenient hotel. However, I probably wouldn't go back because they allow dogs on the premise. For people who don't mind staying next door to a dog, I would recommend this hotel. My family stayed at this hotel for three nights while on vacation. The location was convenient to Disneyland Resort (35 minutes), Hollywood (20 minutes), Santa Monica Beach (20 minutes)and shopping. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We needed extra towels and within minutes there was a knock at the door with these items, as well as a phone call to make sure we got them. The hotel was clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again! everything nice! friendly staff a perfect hotel for \"up in the air\" easy to find and more than close to the airport, takes only 5 minutes to start your flight. To Santa Monica max 15min by car! no problems at all, parking only as valet, or 5 minutes walking distance. Nice small pool for a rest! nice Club Lounge with a very friendly staff like for exsample Juan! allways helpfull and friendly. I stayed at the Sheraton for 1 night (May 31, 2010). Got a decent deal through priceline.com (70 INCLUDING taxes and fees). It's ranked as a 4*, however, it's more of a 3-1/2 * for the following reasons:\n",
      " 1) Unless you want to pay $25 for valet parking, the self-park lot is a good 5 minute walk during the day, and 7 minute walk @ night (the back door is locked after 9pm). Although, the self-park is only $13.\n",
      " 2) The hotel is showing it's age - spotty wallpaper, etc.\n",
      " 3) Plastic cups in a 4*???\n",
      " 4) Could hear the neighbors hotel phone ring constantly (thin walls???)\n",
      "Otherwise, the hotel was clean, reception was quick and polite. Would stay here again. I consider myself to be a very savvy, discriminating traveler. I have racked up nearly 4 million miles on one Airline alone and have spent countless nights in just about every major hotel chain. I have stayed at this hotel for a total of 7 nights in the past two weeks. I can tell you that the service at this hotel is consistently better than anything I have ever experienced including that at 5 star resorts in major cities throughout the world. I am not sure exactly how they do it but EVERYONE makes you feel special and honestly tries to exceed your expectations. From the incredible gentleman at the front door (Samuel), to the people at the front desk who take the time to learn and remember your name, to the hosts and wait staff in BOTH restaurants who are willing to work with you to meet your dietary needs. The concierge who didn't make me wait and printed directions and delivered them to my room and the second concierge who took care of a fax for me as I dashed out the door. It really goes on and on. All of the staff (literally) have been trained (??) to go that extra mile that really makes a difference. Also, despite being at LAX, the rooms are extremely quiet and the beds are comfortable. The gym is clean and pretty large. There is a beautiful pool area. Now is it absolutely perfect? No. The carpet has a tear on the third floor. My shower didn't drain as fast as it should. But I am positive that had I told someone about this, it would have been fixed ASAP. In fact, I bet they have someone on it right now. I am going to have to spend the next four months of my life in a hotel 4 days a week. I am so happy to have found a place that genuinely wants to make my stay as good as it possibly can be. Congratulations to you (the team at Sheraton Gateway) for what you have accomplished together. Got this hotel twice through Hotwire - once in March 2010 and once in April 2010. Both times I had a pleasant experience.\n",
      "Rooms was big and clean. Front desk staff was pleasant every time. Ate in the restaurant once and the food was good and the service was excellent.\n",
      "I do hate having to pay for internet access in this day and age though. The airport shuttle drivers were also hit and miss. One was really lazy and refused to help anyone with their bags.\n",
      "If you have a rental car, there is no self-parking at this hotel! And if you pull up to unload they will tell you to move. There is street parking behind it though. It's the easiest part of your day when you head to the club lounge in the am and Juan Gomez is working. He's a pleasure to have in the club lounge! Best location for our convention! Rooms were very clean and friendly staff, our convetion was held in the main ballroom and the staff was very helpful! trough out our stay we soend most of our time at the convention, the food was like a pic nic at the park affordable, we love the snack cart at our game table, since we could not get up for long periods of time. breakfast buffet was very good and affordable! we come once a year and my stay has been great so far....! only the parking was pricy! and no in and out privileges. the starbucks was closed to early! The view was beautiful from where we were at, the bathrooms were really nice and clean, bed was very comfy and cozy. Everything was perfect, except for the thin walls but we didnt have noisy neighbors so it was ok, ALSO: parking is not free! It's about $13-15/night depending on where u park so be prepared for that if you plan on staying for a while. The restaurant had pretty good food for the price we paid. We wanted to but didnt have enough time to stop by the bar down in the lobby, but we will for sure next time. The workers there were really friendly and helpful ( we had some issues with the bill when we were checking out but it was quickly resolved and we were happy)...can't wait to go back in July:) So, after leaving Palm Springs, we decided to stay at the Sheraton Gateway-LAX. While I remember this hotel meeting my needs 2 years ago, this time it did everything but. First off the Valet guys were very cocky and arrogant, and allowed another car to hit my car while it was parked. Thank God no damage was done! They blamed the other car for being a stick shift no realizing that they are in charge of all cars with keys in their possession. \n",
      "So, on Saturday night I guess some sorority had a function, and some students attended prom at the Sheraton and decided to pull the fire alarm on the 11th FL which caused everyone to wake up at 1:30-2 am. After discovering it was a false alarm the security of the hotel decided that it would be wise to sit by my door and talk with hotel guest while his walkie talkie was sounding. Needless to say, I got no sleep that night! I felt as thought it was college all over again.\n",
      "Lastly, housekeeping comes knocking on your door at 830-9am asking you what time can they clean your room (WTF!!!)!\n",
      "Some ratings give it a 4 star, and I will say no way. Small rooms, bathrooms, sort of outdated, etc.... I wouldnt argue if someone said 3 star, but not a 4 people! As it is every time we stay with you, we are always happy with our room and service but in particular, we would like to comment on one of your staff JUAN in the Club Lounge. We have always found him to be polite with exceptional customer focus and service. Juan has always made our visits enjoyable. Well done Juan.\n",
      "Leslie & Val Hovan\n",
      "Sydney, Australia Stayed in this hotel whilst transiting from Asia to the East Coast of the US. \n",
      "Hotel looks good as you enter into the lobby. However the rooms are dated and the bathroom could definitely have done with a good cleaning - \"what's that red coloring in the tile grout on the floor?\"\n",
      "Bedroom was very roomy, and had all the features I would require for a short stay. Had WiFi, but you do have to pay for it :-(. There was a lot of TV noise from neighboring rooms which ended up wakening me up way before I wanted to, not what you want when you're trying to catch up on lost sleep.\n",
      "Not a lot of external noise which was good considering the proximity to LAX.\n",
      "Had a few drinks and late snack in the lobby bar, service was good and the sandwich was very tasty.\n",
      "Have a good buffet breakfast.\n",
      "Probably wouldn't stay here again as there are other hotels that I could try and this one did not grab me to come back again My partner and I were on a business trip to LA and stayed at the Sheraton Gateway for three days. Our meetings were held in the hotel's conference center, therefore, we ate lunch at the Brasserie for convenience. Our first lunch server was Miguel who gave us wonderful service and great food. So wonderful that we decided to go back the next day and ask for Miguel to serve us. Then, on our third day, we visited Miguel yet again for more wonderful service and this time, we brought our friends. I'm very happy with the service I've been receiving from Sheraton and especially, from the Sheraton LAX. The staff at LAX Sheraton put a new spin on the term customer service. From the Club Lounge - where Juan Gomez doesn't just ask if I need anything, but does the tasks of keeping customers like myself happy by picking up plates, refreshing the food station setup, always greeting me, and helping out with luggage - to the Front Desk where staff immediately changed my room because of issue I had, with no questions. The same holds true of the downstairs open air bar where all the staff are courteous, efficient, and friendly. I stay at five star hotels while on business travel in Europeannd I have to say, Sheraton LAX is at the same level of service as many of these same hotels. It's comparable to the service I receive at the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point, CA. Kudos to the staff and to the people who train the staff. After reading the reviews, and after a horrid stay at the Westin a couple of weeks prior, this SPG Gold turning Platinum guest expected it couldn't have been any worse. It wasn't worse, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped. First, check in was average. Two SPG line front desk clerks on the phone, so I waited for a bit at checkin. Got my room, and went up. As reviews indicate bathroom average at best; bed was actually pretty comfy, and the size of the room not bad. Thank goodness for the AC/Fan, as it for the most part drowned out the airplane take off noise. My wake up call assurred to me at checkin never happened...good thing I was up early anyway, and my appointment wasn't until noon that Sunday. Good thing I didn't have a flight.\n",
      "The next morning,I took the shuttle back to the airport, then to Avis to rent my car for the next two days. I drove up to the valet and told him I would check out in an hour, and how much valet was. $10 he said. I asked if there was any self-park, and he said there was, behind the hotel, and the first 2 hours was free. After driving around quite a bit, I finally found the lot, in the paid traveler lot behind the hotel. At check out, an hour later, I asked about the free parking for 2 hours, and if I needed a ticket validated. The front desk stated she did not know, and she did not have to do anything. As I drove out, I was charged $8.25 because I didn't have a white ticket that the valet was supposed to give me! This is unacceptable, and I was quite mad--mad enough that I likely will try the Marriott or Embassy Suites down the street. Very disappointed in this hotel's service and noise. Now, Westin is worse, but as an annual Gold member, this is not the level of experience I am used to. Being welcomed by a very genuine and positive agent (A. Smith) at the frent desk was the first of many great experiences at the hotel. \n",
      "Also - joyning the breakfast buffet i had the pleasure of encountering both Hector and Antonio - who supplyed the guests with a good mood + great service. I recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX. This was my first trip to Los Angeles and I was traveling for business reasons so did not have a choice on where to stay. Here is what I thought about the property:\n",
      "Front Desk Check In: We arrived before the check in time and there was no wait at the front desk. The front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful and checked us into the rooms early because there were extra rooms available. \n",
      "Rooms: The room that I stayed in was a one bedroom standard non-smoking room with a king bed. Each room had a LG flat panel television, iron, ironing board, small recliner chair, and a desk to work on. At the Sheraton, unless you are a SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest Elite Status) member, wi-fi internet access in the rooms is not available free of charge. Wi-FI is available but will be charged to your room. I am not sure what the rate was for Wi-FI in the rooms but downstairs in the lobby area, pay internet was offered by the hotel for a fee of $6.95 for 15 minutes so I would assume that the price points would be similar. The beds were very comfortable and I found the sheets and pillow cases fresh and clean. No problems there.\n",
      "Lobby Area: The Sheraton has a very large lobby bar which was open most of the day into the evening hours. All around the lobby bar area were large contemporary looking benches that had lg flatpanel televisions that were playing various programming such as ESPN, and CNN. The lobby bar area was quite big and could accommodate a large amount of people.\n",
      "Pool Area: The pool at the Sheraton was really nice. Outside, they had tables and chairs set up along side poolside cabanas. Also, there was a hot tub located adjacent to the pool. I did not get a chance to swim in the pool because the weather was too cold at the time of my visit but it looks like a nice area for a quick dip during your stay.\n",
      "Restaurants/Room Service: I did not order room service but the menu did have a wide selection of items to choose from but was a little pricey $$$ for my budget. If you wanted something quick to eat, there is a subway right next store to the hotel. There is also a full service steakhouse located on the lobby level but is also $$$ and did not go into the restaurant.\n",
      "Finally, in the lobby area, there is a small sundry shop in which you could pick up small essentials that you may have forgotten at home as well as snacks, juices and soft drinks, ice cream bars, and small Los Angeles souveniers.\n",
      "The Sheraton is a nice property if you need to find a hotel near LAX which has great shuttle service to and from the airport. In times when the travel industry is lacking in the service department it is refreshing and pleasant to stay at a hotel that has exceptional customer service. Although all employees were very helpful and friendly three standouts were: Antonio (Restaurant breakfast) Frank (Room service ordering) and Whitney (front desk) The atmosphere and design of the hotel is very stylish, calm and comforting. Great stay. I was here for a conference and all staff were extremely attentive and conscientious. Whenever we needed assistance during our conference, even if we made changes (e.g. more food, different delivery time), they were friendly about all requests. I would absolutely recommend for any conferences you may need to schedule! The food was also very good for the lunch they catered. The location is unbeatable.\n",
      "Furthermore, they were having a Wii bowling tournament on Wednesday night and the gentleman running it (I think his name was Eric?) was so friendly and fun! It was almost like I wasn't at work!\n",
      "Downside- I could hear the airplanes when I went to bed, although it wasn't too loud to keep me from sleeping. Also, the bathroom was just mediocre. On the other hand, the bed was fabulous! I booked this through my company travel agent as I was in the USA for a business trip. LAX was just a stopover so I checked in about 10pm at night and 7am in the morning. For the rate that my company got me, it was quite value for money and reasonable. This is an airport hotel so once you have checked in, the Sheraton Gateway is like any other chain hotel. I suppose I expected more 'personality' and more 'atmosphere' but perhaps it was my expectations that needed to be managed as this is really just an airport hotel. \n",
      " In addition, It was surprising however that my corporate rate didnt include breakfast, esp when I turned up in the morning at the restaurant expecting everything to have been paid for already. The pick up from the airport to the hotel and return was efficient and the wait shouldnt take more than 15 minutes. You have to pay for wi-fi and internet access to your room. \n",
      "I dont really see any differentiation factors between this hotel and any other standard hotel. But for the price that I got, it was fine. If I were at the airport area I might consider staying here again. We had an enforced stay at this hotel owing to the volcanic ash grounding flights.We found the rooms to be very clean and comfortable and there was no discernible aircraft noise..Meals were tasty with notably good soupes de jour.The staff were helpful and we would wish to single out Lilia who cleaned our room and the ever cheerful Miguel in the dining room.The concierge staff were very helpful in planning journeys using LA's buses.The extras like the weekly WII tournament and complimentary popcorn to watch a movie were much appreciated.\n",
      "Not many people stay 6 consecutive nights in an airport hotel.We did and in the Sheraton Gateway we were very well looked after. I have frequently enjoyed my stays at the Sheraton Gateway, La.\n",
      "It is usually for pleasure.\n",
      "The staff always make you feel welcome and enhances the quality of the visit.\n",
      "In Late December, shortly before Christmas, my daughter required knee surgery that was far more complicated that anticipated.\n",
      "The Staff at the Sheraton,especially Whitney Johnson, who checked us in, turned a somewhat unpleasant situation into one that reassured me of the calibre and high quality of service that has become the norm at that hotel.\n",
      "Everyone was so helpful and empathetic.\n",
      "I felt so helpless , but thanks to their excellent help and professionalism, my glass...during that difficult time became half full rather that half empty. As a matter fo fact...it was overflowing!!!\n",
      "EXCELLENT HOTEL!!!!! I always appreciate, especially from airport area hotels, when the greeting from the front desk personnel is warm and friendly. The Sheraton has this, great job front desk and kudos to the inhouse IT help that got my computer running. I travel a lot for business and stay frequently at the LAX Sheraton now the Westin down the street has gotten very tired. The service at the Sheraton is great and the food is outstanding. They have a real chef working there which is not common for an airport hotel. It is the best hotel at LAX and I have tried them all. My two teenagers and I spent four days at the Gateway. Prysler was our bellman. He was very helpful with tips on sightseeing and generally getting around L.A. He was very enthusiastic and expressed his appreciation to be able to work there. We received a daily discount if we didn't request our rooms to be made up...which was fine with us. The elevators are fast, the computers very accessible and the front desk helped us with ordering take out with a selection of menus on hand. We will be going back soon, and will DEFINITELY stay here again! It was a beautiful experience! This hotel is the best that I have had the pleasure to stay in. From the check-in, Beena, very pleasant and professional processed me in in an instantance and informed me of the amenities the hotel have to offer and the restaurants. On check-out, Rheziel, again like Beena, pleasant and professional processed me out in an instance, I would like to commend the Front Desk Manager for having such well-trained and knowledgeable, pleasant and professional employees, job well done. From the moment I dorve up to the hotel, I felt welcome and relaxed just like being at home, I will most definitely recommend this hotel to all that would like to have a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. I love this hotel and the employees, it is off the scale of five stars, can not get any better. My family of four all got a stomach bug (from friends, not the hotel!), which resulted in us being stuck in our room for 3 days. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, providing us with abundant towels, sheets, etc. as often as needed. Front desk staff called at least once a day to check in and make sure we were doing okay. All in all, a lousy vacation, but the staff at this Sheraton went out of their way to help us out at a tough time. \n",
      "Also a positive--they removed a few phone and internet charges, without my asking. I thought that was an extremely nice gesture. I would definitely go back. I finished my business week with this hotel. After a week in Los Angeles I expected the typical rude service we have all become accustom too. The check in process was typical with the young girls into their own world. That passed quickly and I went to my room. The hotel was spotless, the room was spotless and appointed well. The maid was just down the hall and I asked her for an extra coffee. She smiled, spoke broken English and happily helped me with my request. I did eat at this hotel. I was single so I went to the lobby bar for a drink and some dinner. The bar was busy with customers but I did find a seat and hoped I would be noticed. There were 2 bartenders that evening with a full bar of customers. I saw there were several attractive ladies and the immediate thought was, great, now I have to deal with the flirting bartender for service. Again to my surprise they were right on with service. I got my drink a menu and the bartender never lost his rhythm with his conversation. My dinner arrived with-in a reasonable time as well. It wae correct and tasted good too. We had an early flight and didn't want to deal with the traffic in the morning so we stayed the night at the Sheraton Gateway @ LAX. Check-in was easy, check-out was easier! We got a great place to stay and a newspaper, too. The shuttle for the airport was waiting for us when we got downstairs so it couldn't have been easier. We didn't eat there, but they have a restaurant and a Starbucks. Short distance from airport, easy acess to freeways. Staff is very friendly always willing to help, thanks Beena at the front desk. Overall this is a quality property. Rooms are clean and updated. Resturants have good food and the bar has a cool vibe. There's even a starbucks in the lobby! We especially love the location of the hotel. two minutes from lax. The pool area is great. the bar and restaurant service is great. The food is slow to come out but the portions are very desent. pricey but come on, its L.A. The atmosphere is appropriate if you just want to hang out minus bells and whistles. the gym is very well equipped. the staff is always very friendly. I am a loyal SPG member which is why the Sheraton was my first choice. I had an early flight and wanted to be close to the airport. I had very little expectation for my experience at the hotel though seeing its proximity to LAX. I was blown away by how friendly, courteous and informative everyone was, even knowing I was merely sleeping at the hotel. It was a wonderful experience and a great way to sleep well my last night in LA. My wife and I have been coming to the Gateway Sheraton in Los Angeles for more than 10 years. Over the past few years, a number of employees have stood out by providing exceptional service. This includes two Concierge employees who work in the lounge on the 15th floor, Juan and Veronica. They are friendly and professional, always. Two bartenders in the restaurant's bar (Mario and Horatio) went out of their way to make us comfortable during this most recent stay. Both also provided exceptional service and were obviously very experienced and pro's at what they do. One addtional comment relates to Mark, the Food Services manager. Without knowing who he was, he answered several un-related food questions about the hotel and was more than helpful in guiding us to answer our questions. Hat's off to the staff at the Gateway!! Keep up the good work!!! BH We arrived 9:30 pm at LAX. The shuttle came in a matter of minutes for the short drive to Sheraton Gateway. The staff at our quick check-in was very curtious and helpful. Our room was large and very clean. The bed ...terrific!! Bathroom shower has great pressure. Our room was extremely quiet. Breakfast the next morning was delicious. \n",
      "Our entire experience with this hotel was fantastic. this hotel is great.\n",
      "the one thing that i am very impressed with is the fact that my daughter\n",
      "left her camera in the room and they found it and returned it to us.\n",
      "its sad to say that doesnt happen all the time.\n",
      "we were very impressed and would definately stay here again\n",
      "the room was clean and super comfortable i wanted to take the bed home with me:) Sheraton Gateway LAX is a nice little oasis of style in the middle of all the uglyness and tackyness of other LAX hotels and restaurants. Sometimes the bar can be a hotspot, even more now that they added the free Link@Sheraton area with free wifi. On the outside the hotel looks like a typical Sheraton mega-chain, but inside decor is sort of a Southern take on a W hotel for the lobby and public areas. The pool has cabanas and they light candles at night. The hotel has lots of suites, so SPG elite members are treated well here. Rooms are recently remodeled, except for the bathrooms, which are well maintained, but still look late 1970's. Not a bad hotel, but they close down the platinum lounge on the weekends. That is not cool, especially since they didn't offer free breakfast in its place. Went to a business conference and then stayed an extra night for leisure. The hotel was nice the atmosphere was great and they even had a Wii in the bar. Had a very pleasant experience and would definitely stay there again. Receptionist Paulo? was fantastic when Sheraton lost my reservation\n",
      "Paparazzi Restaurant\n",
      "House bread was served with dried tomato tapenade\n",
      "Nice grilled romaine salad\n",
      "Genovese shrimp with pesto and linguini had an unusual taste\n",
      "Great food presentations\n",
      "Very friendly, but slow, food service\n",
      "Nice wines by the glass\n",
      "Charge for parking\n",
      "Charge for internet We stayed at the hotel as we were going to a concert nearby. We drove up from San Diego with friends and booked two rooms. The hotel was doing repairs on the elevators so it was slow getting to our rooms on the 10th floor, which I would not have worried about except that our keycards did not work and it took three trips to the lobby to get it sorted out - which was a very slow process given the elevator repairs! \n",
      "The room was nice and clean and we also stopped for a drink in the bar before we went out and the bar was quite nice.\n",
      "Where the hotel failed us was in customer service. After we returned to the hotel after the concert (at around 11 pm) the people in the adjoining room made so much noise that we couldnt sleep. After putting up with it for an hour or so we called the lobby to complain but the noise continued. Several more complaint calls and still nothing. At around 4 am after our final call we heard security come up and knock on their door and finally all was quiet. Unfortunately we had to be up at 8 am the next morning as we had plans with our friends. It was disappointing to pay for a hotel room to sleep in when we couldnt get any sleep!\n",
      "I sent a written complaint to the hotel after our stay but did not even get the courtesay of a response. While I understand this was mainly just bad luck on our part in that the people in the adjoining room were very noisey and this may have been a one off event, it certainly has deterred me from ever returning or recommending the hotel.\n",
      "On a side note, the LAX area is not really convenient to anything, so I would only recommend getting a hotel near LAX if you have an early flight out the next day. We used it because it was close to LAX and quite affordable given the level of comfort. In that regard, we were pleased. The view of airplanes landing and taking off was entertaining. Not noisy, surprisingly.\n",
      "We lose time figuring out where to park. The front entry was so crowded that it took us 15-20 minutes just to get the info. The parking behind the hotel is not well advertised and it is a 5-10 minute walk; they prefer that you pay the full parking valet price. In short, the parking arrangements suck. The breakfast is way too expensive. Close to the airport, without any airport noise, this place fit the bill for a one night stay. Bus to & from LAX was easy & quick and my room was big and comfortable, with a shower that really rocked. Only negatives was the slow check in and only one restaurant. We ate at the bar because the restaurant was a 20-30 minute wait, not because it was full, but because they didn't schedule enough wait staff. We missed our flight and received two rooms from the airplane company as per compensation for missing our flight.\n",
      "By mistake the lady at the counter of united gave me only one voucher for the night instead of two vouchers. When we came to the hotel and we explained that we have two rooms they told us to call united and ask them to fax the voucher to them. We were very tired, it was 1am, and I asked the manager if maybe he by himself can call united and ask for this voucher. After 20 minutes wait he came to me and said that he is very sorry, but he couldnt reach any one at united.\n",
      " I think that as a service of the hotel he should have offered us a room and try to get his voucher the next day. ....... We spent two nights here in January, we used the Sheraton inbetween our flights from Toronto to Maui at the beginning and end of our vacation. We really like the sweet sleeper beds and the fact that it is one of the only hotels in the area that has two queen beds was the reason for booking. I kept checking their website and got a rate of $89 for each night. We were upgraded to a suite on the second stay which was nice because we were there longer. Very quiet considering how close to LAX and efficient staff. We ate breakfast at the buffet in the morning and though it was good we paid nearly as much for it as we paid for the room. The shuttle to airport runs on a regular basis and was easy to deal with each time. Lage: Zwischen dem Flughafen LAX und den großen Autovermietern. Sind mit dem Shuttle von Alamo dran vorbeigefahren. Von Alamo aus etwa 3 Minuten mit dem Auto. Von den anderen Autovermietern nicht viel länger. Das Hotel verfügt auch über einen eigenen Shuttle zum Flughafen.\n",
      "Wir haben dieses Hotel als erstes und als letztes unserer USA-Westen-Rundreise 2012 gebucht.\n",
      "Das Personal war freundlich, die Zimmer sauber und ruhig (beide Male). Blick direkt auf den Flughafen ist zwar kein Blick über L.A., aber dafür ist es preislich entsprechend in Ordnung. Die Verglasung der Fenster ist so gut, dass man wirklich nichts von draussen hört.\n",
      "Das Valet-Parking ging schnell und ohne Probleme. Am Ende unserer Reise wurde uns mit dem (mittlerweile angewachsenen) Gepäck geholfen. Das Servicepersonal hat auch für uns im Internet nachgesehen, ob die Rückflugzeiten geblieben sind.\n",
      "Man hat mehrere Möglichkeiten im Hotel zu essen, wir haben aber nur den im Erdgeschoss befindlichen Starbucks genutzt, der eben ein Starbucks ist.\n",
      "Um sich L.A. anzusehen muss man natürlich dann vom Hotel aus recht viel herumfahren, aber bei der schieren Größe der Stadt, muss man das von jedem Hotel, sofern man mindestens einen Strand und z.B. Hollywood sehen möchte.\n",
      "Sollten wir noch einmal nach L.A. fliegen, würden wir dieses Hotel wieder buchen. Hotel molto bello, confortevole, vicino all'aeroporto e comodo se si è in auto come noi, per girare Los Angeles, Disneyland hollywood, beverly hills.... \n",
      "Letti comodi (eravamo 2 adulti e 2 bambini in stanza) e siamo stati comodi e bene\n",
      "WiFi a pagamento unica pecca appena fuori dall'aereoporto sia per chi arriva dal lungo viaggio che per chi parte da lax è davvero un compromesso ottimo poichè girare a lax non è cosa semplice e sbrigativa perciò questo albergo offre una posizione invidiabile.camere molto grandi e belle dotato di ogni servizio da parcheggio (a pagamento 12 dollari al giorno, non è pero male) al servizio di assistenza molto presente e puntuale.io lo consiglio los angeles è una citta complessa da girare e lo sheraton offre molto come posizione a pochi minuti si arriva facilmente a venice beach e santa monica due localita molto belle da visitare, consiglio anche manhattan beach Lage:\n",
      "Zentrale Lage in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Flughafen LAX. Shuttlebusse verkehren im Abstand von ca. 15-20 Minuten zwischen allen Terminals sowie dem Hotel. Die Fahrzeit beträgt vom Tom Bradley International Terminal aus weniger als 5-10 Minuten. Das Hotel ist auch fußläufig vom Flughafen binnen 10 Minuten zu erreichen.\n",
      "Nach Downtown LA gelangt man am besten mit den FlyAway-Bussen, die vor jedem Terminal in LAX einen Halt einlegen; für USD 7,00 gelangt man direkt und sehr komfortabel zur Union Station – deutlich angenehmer als mit dem öffentlichen Nahverkehr!\n",
      "Hotel:\n",
      "Großes Haus mit 15 Etagen und internationalem Publikum; das Hotel ist auch Herberge für diverse nationale und internationale Flightcrews.\n",
      "Das Hotel selbst bietet verschiedene Restaurants, Bars sowie einen Starbucks und einen Souveniershop. In näherer Umgebung ist es für den Selbstversorger dabei eher schwierig, sich mit Getränken und Lebensmitteln zu versorgen; im nahe gelegenen Westchester gibt es jedoch Geschäfte des täglichen Bedarfs.\n",
      "Zimmer:\n",
      "Die Standardzimmer haben eine ordentliche Größe von rund 27m²; leider verbaut der überdimensionierte Fernsehschrank das Zimmer ein wenig. Bezüglich der Aussicht darf man in den unteren Etagen nicht zu viel erwarten; wer etwas vom Flugbetrieb sehen möchte, der sollte einen Raum in den oberen Etagen erfragen.\n",
      "Die Zimmereinrichtung erscheint noch relativ „frisch“ und modern; das Bad ist üblicher Sheraton-Standard.\n",
      "Die Nähe zum Flughafen bekommt man als Gast zweifelsohne mit – auch wenn die Schallisolierung der Zimmer / Fenster gut ist. Startende Flugzeuge sind jedoch – je nach Ausrichtung des Zimmers – gut zu hören.\n",
      "Fazit:\n",
      "Sicherlich kein klassisches Urlaubshotel für Los Angeles; doch mit dem Mietwagen ist man schnell (sofern man in LA davon sprechen kann) an den Sehenswürdigkeiten angelangt. Für preisbewusste (und für Interessierte der Luftfahrt) sicherlich eine erwähnenswerte Alternative. abbiamo soggiornato una sola notte, ma siamo rimasti li anche tutto un pomeriggio che fra negozio, bar e ristorante e internet è trascorso velocemente. La camera è molto spaziosa, il bagno un po' meno. Bella la piscina anche se quando ci siamo andati noi era invasa da un gruppo di ragazze che avevano occupato tutti i lettini. Magari l'albergo dovrebbe vietare il \"blocco\" lettini per chi sa chi! Comunque per avere 800 camere è tenuto magnificamente, ben pulito e le camere, pur essendo nel mezzo dell'aeroporto, sono silenziosissime. Ci ritornerei se dovessi andare ancora a Lax - sicuramente il migliore che c'è nelle vicinanze dell'aeroporto. Hotel nel complesso non male anche se un pò datato. Stanza sufficientemente grande . Aria condizionata ben funzionante letti molto comodi e biancheria pulita e di discreta qualità.La nostra stanza era comunicante con un' altra quindi se anche la vostra lo fosse accertatevi sempre che sia ben chiusa la porta di comunicazione. Pulizia buona. La colazione self service è discreta ed abbastanza assortita. I miei figli adoravano i cereali con i marshmallows ! Gli ambienti comuni sono ben tenuti e all'interno dell'hotel c'è una piccola , ma carina, piscina un ristorante ed un negozio di souvenir. La cosa migliore dell'hotel dal mio punto di vista è la posizione perchè con la macchina sei comodo per raggiungere tutti i vari posti da visitare. E vi assicuro che Los Angeles non puoi visitarla senza macchina!E' talmente grande!Tra l'altro è molto vicino e comodo all'aeroporto ed a tutti i rent a car dell'aeroporto. Se vorrete mangiare un bell'hamburger non lontano, ma sempre con l'auto, potrete trovare un In-n- out burger. Nel complesso devo dire che consiglierei questo albergo a che non vuole spendere tanto (LA è cara x gli hotel)ma avere una buona qualità ed una posizione comodo x vedere la città.Cosa molto importante:c'è un grande posteggio dietro l'hotel . Dite subito all'ingresso che siete all'hotel sheraton e per quanti gg starete cosi potrete entrare ed uscire da esso a vostro piacimento senza pagare ogni volta. トランジット用のホテルと割り切るには値段は高めですし、何のメリットがあってここのホテルに泊まるかは考えものです。\n",
      "割りとフロントデスクの周辺はざわついていて、ゆったりとした雰囲気ではありませんでした。\n",
      "部屋は快適な広さでしたが、残念なことに冷蔵庫がありませんでした。\n",
      "スターポイント利用か、宿泊費が安い時に泊まるのがベストかと思います。2万以上出して泊まるべきではないと思います。 Wir haben die ersten beiden Nächte dort übernachtet. Es ist trotz Flughafennähe sehr leise. Ein Starbucks ist im Hause und daher ist fürs Frühstück gesorgt. Zimmer sehr sauber und der Service am Emfang total hilfsbereit und nett. Ein toller Pool ist ebenfalls vorhanden. Also wir würden dieses Hotel auf jeden Fall wieder buchen. Preis-Leistungs stimmt hier auf alle Fälle. 8月25日に一泊しました。７階の部屋からは飛行機の離陸と着陸が見え好きな方はお奨めです。チェックインの際、I wanna stay airportsideとリクエストすれば、希望通りになるかと思います。\n",
      "ホテルは空港の目の前なので、早朝のフライト乗り継ぎでも重宝するホテルです。 Très bien situé car près de l’aéroport.\n",
      "Accueil très pro, efficace, chambre spacieuse, propre, à mon arrivée, la baignoire était bouchée, intervention du technicien rapide et efficace, avec lettre d'excuses à l'appui. Par contre internet dans la chambre payant, sauf dans les parties communes (bar, accueil, salons...).\n",
      "Chambre bien isolée phonétiquement. Sono stato in questo hotel dal 17 al 21 agosto 2012 durante un viaggio con la mia morosa.\n",
      "L' hotel scelto dall' Italia, è bello, molto grande e anche molto fuori dai luoghi interessanti di Los Angeles, ma comunque è una città che va girata in macchina quindi non è quello il problema.\n",
      "Le camere sono pulite, tutto a posto se non che al ritorno mi sono trovato addebitati sulla carta 100 euro...Ho scritto all' hotel, dato che avevo gia pagato e loro mi hanno risposto che era per il parcheggio, ma non hanno pensato di specificarlo prima, ma zitti zitti l' hanno accreditato dopo...comunque morale tutti gentili mi hanno girato anche la fattura, 31 dollari al giorno per il parcheggio.Con questa mossa mi sono caduti molto, da una catena cosi non me l' aspettavo.Lo dicessero prima uno è libero di scegliere se gli sta bene o no, ma cosi prima te lo fanno passare gentilezza e servizio offerto, dato che è praticamente obbligatorio, come arrivi ci sono i valletti che ti prendono su la macchina...In più è di fronte all' aeroporto, io ho il sonno pesante quindi non mi ha cambiato nulla ad essere sincero, però c'è un gran traffico aereo avanti e indietro per chi avesse il sonno leggero sconsigliato. Stanza di giuste dimensioni con due letti queen size quelli famosi ad una piazza e mezza una scrivania ed una zona lettura che date le dimensioni della stanza se la potevano certamente risparmiare visto l'ingombro della poltrona. Pessimo anche il fatto che per due letti c'e' un solo un abat-jour quind se uno vuole dormire e l'altro leggere e' un problema. Davanti a letto il televisore LCD con i soliti canali.\n",
      "Bagno : troppo piccolo. Veramente troppo non e' proprio nelle prerogative dello Sheaton avere dei bagni così piccoli. Tra l'altro non ci hanno dato una saponetta che fosse una ma solo una bottiglietta di shampoo e una di balsamo. Prima del bagno un armadio a muro ma senza cassaforte.\n",
      "Assenza di un frigobar (direi grave permil livello dell'hotel) ma presente una macchinetta del caffè con una bustina di caffè d Starbucks (almeno quello) ma senza cucchiaino ne' bastoncino per girare il caffè ....affaccio su l'autostrada e dietro la pista dell'aeroporto di Los Angeles con un via vai di aerei notturni che e' stato un piacere...\n",
      "Ultima chicca: connessione internet in stanza a pagamento, 12.50$ per 24 ore...mi e' veramente sembrato un furto.\n",
      "La reception e' molto grande ma pessimamente presidiata. La sera alle 23.30 abbiamo fatto la fila er fare il check in perché presente un sol operatore di staff. Tra l'altro ci e' stato detto che la nostra camera richiesta (un mese e mezzo prima) ovvero una King Size non era disponibile e per questo ci hanno dato una queen size con due letti. Inoltre sul conti inae ci siam trovati un doppio addebito di internet (che abbiamo ovviamente fatto stornare). Internet nella lobby e' ovviamente gratis ma col cavolo che il solerte personale ci ha avvertito e quindi abbiamo speso quei dollari completamente in modo inutile...\n",
      "A piano terra un bar aperto fino a tardi ed uno Starbucks per fare colazione (ovviamente non inclusa). Se lo si desidera si può fare colazione in stanza basta compilare il cartoncino con l'ordine fuori della propria porta e pagare tra i 15 e i 20$\n",
      "Comodo il servizio shuttle tra l'aeroporto di Los Angeles e l'hotel e viceversa che viene messo a disposizione H24 con frequenza 20 minuti, c si risparmia i soldi del taxi. Per il resto il solito anonimo hotel della cintura aeroportuale, frequentato molto da persone in trasferta, con pessimi servizi e tutti ovviamente a pagamento (visto che paga solitamente l'azienda). 深夜便（零時過ぎ）の到着で、朝までの利用でした。送迎は夜中も動いていましたが、Sheratonのオレンジぽいバスがよく見えなくて、1回見過ごしましたが、空港内を周回してるので直ぐにまた来ました。WestinやHiltonは、わかりやすいのに、Sheratonは、いまいちわかりづらいと思います。\n",
      "ホテルは、Sheratonとしては、普通ですが、空港の飛行機の離発着が見えたのが、なんとなく良かった。\n",
      "朝食の品数は、ちょっと少ない気がします。 Prenoto questo Sheraton per motivi di comodità logistica, arrivando dal Messico di sabato e avendo il volo di rientro verso l'Italia di domenica. Non avevo particolari necessità o aspettative anche se resta che normalmente il marchio Sheraton è garanzia di qualità, servizio, attenzione. Per quel che riguarda l'hotel in oggetto, nulla di tutto questo è stato confermato, tranne la grandezza delle stanze. Il personale è scontroso, dal car valet al concierge, l'hotel è limitatissimo (dovremmo essere in America,... cavolo..... dove internet gratuito lo trovi anche nei bagni pubblici mentre qui è richiesto un pagamento profumatissimo), i complimentary inesistenti (che lo Sheraton non ti omaggi di una bottiglietta d'acqua in camera è scandaloso) e dubbi perchè non è scritto chiaramente che tutto è a pagamento. Peccato, un neo (e anche bello grosso) per la catena. Das Hotel wird vom Flughafen LAX per Shuttleservice etwa alle 15 Minuten bedient (Fahrzeit etwa 10 Minuten). Die Zimmergröße ist akzeptabel. Eine 4-köpfige Familie findet problemlos in einem Zimmer mit zwei Queensize-Betten Platz. Gute Schallisolation garantiert ordentliche Schlafqualität trotz Flugplatznähe. Starbucks und zwei Restaurants sind im Hause, ansonsten gibt es in der Umgebung wenig Möglichkeiten um zu essen. Praktisch ist, dass Camperverleiher wie El Monte direkten Shuttleservice zum Hotel anbieten. Für die Spritztour mit dem Auto durch Los Angeles bietet sich die Vermietstation \"Midway\" in unmittelbarer Hotelnähe an: sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis, freundliches Personal). Autoreservierung direkt über Concierge im Hotel. Anbindung des Hotels an öffentlichen Verkehr (Metro) sehr mühsam und nicht empfehlenswert. Insgesamt ein angenehmes und praktisches Hotel für Start und Abschluß eines Trips durch den Südwesten. Buchung am besten über deutsche Internetanbieter. très bien situé et bien desservi par une navette gratuite souvent bondée . \n",
      "Formalités rapides , bon accueil en tant que membre prefered guest . \n",
      "Chambre de taille correcte très bien équipée , Internet offert si vous êtes membre prefered . \n",
      "je déplore les horaires du restaurant plutôt restreints !! \n",
      "L'hôtel est idéalement situé à l'entrée de LAX et vous ne devez pas quitté trop tôt avant votre vol Hôtel très chic à côté de l'aéroport, des locations de voitures, bien situé. Check-in rapide et service ok. Chambres spacieuses avec des lits queen bed plus que confortables. Petit-déjeuner excellent, saumon frais, jus d'orange frais, oeufs, toats... le meilleur du séjour. \n",
      "A recommander si vous désirez près de l'aéroport et à 30-60min de Venice Beach. Nous avons séjourné dans cet hôtel car nous partions vers San Francisco le lendemain matin. Mieux que le Hilton. chambre agréable et hotel bien situé, proche de l'aéroport sur un axe facile pour visiter la ville, nous nous sommes rendus à Santa Monica aussi bien qu'à Hollywood sans difficulté (merci quand même au gps) de toute façon il faut rouler, la ville est immense... la piscine exterieure et le jacuzzi sont très agréables, il y a un parking juste à côté ,payant mais tarif correct. services en chambre agréables aussi, je recommande cet hotel. Sehr großes modernes Hotel in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Airport LAX in einem Gewerbegebiet. Schöne große gut schallgedämmte Zimmer mit großem Bad, Wannenbad, bequeme Betten und Flachbildschirm TV. 2 Restaurants im Hause mit begrenztem Angebot an Gerichten, aber schmackhaft und gerade noch akzeptable Preise. Außenpool. 24h-Shuttleservice zum Airport. In der Nähe sind keine anderen Restaurants. Frühstück kostenpflichtig im Restaurant. Insgesamt ein günstiges und sehr gutes Hotel auch für einen längeren Aufenthalt geeignet. pour accéder à cet hôtel vous disposez d'une navette entre l'aéroport et l'hôtel. Cette navette propre à l'hôtel vous récupère dès la sortie de l'aéroport (au niveau où se trouvent les bagages). Elle fonctionne 24h/24.\n",
      "L'hôtel est bien entretenu. Le check in rapide. A priori pas de bagagiste pour vous aider à porter vos valises. Les chambres sont spacieuses et propres et bien insonotisées. Pas de micro ondes ni de frigo.\n",
      "Le petit déjeuner sous forme de buffet est de bonne qualité.\n",
      "Le Wifi est en supplément. La piscine est chauffée et très agréable.\n",
      "Le personnel est très professionnel et accueillant.\n",
      "Il n'y a pas grand chose autour de l'hôtel ce qui à mon sens en fait juste un bon hôtel de passage.\n",
      "L'hôtel a une belle salle de cardio training, 2 restaurants et un starbuck. ロサンゼルス空港に夜遅くつく便だったので、利用しました。\n",
      "空港から近くてシャトルバスもあり便利でした。\n",
      "またホテルの1階にはきれいなバーレストランがあったので、夜外に出歩かなくてすみました。\n",
      "お部屋はとても広々していておしゃれでした。 Wir haben nach unserer Landung in LA hier übernachtet und die Lage ist absolut genial - in der Nähe vom Flughafen und ganz in der Nähe der Autovermietstation. Außerdem sind wir am Samstag sehr früh zu unserer 3-wöchigen Rundreise aufgebrochen und der Verkehr war überhaupt kein Problem. Das Hotel sieht von außen zwar nicht so schön aus, aber die Lobby ist schön, angenehme ruhige Musik, das Einchecken gegen 20.30h überhaupt kein Problem und wir waren gerade die einzigen Gäste zum einchecken und das Personal war total freundlich. Das Zimmer war sauber, ruhig und groß und wir haben überhaupt keinen Fluglärm gehört. Die Klimaanlage war ebenfalls kaum zu hören.Der Pool war gerade geschlossen, aber da wir so spät angekommen sind und es außerdem nur ca. 20 Grad hatte, ging uns der auch nicht ab. Wir haben das Auto hinter dem Hotel geparkt und $ 13,50 bezahlt - zahlt sich aus, da der Weg wirklich nicht weit ist. Im Hotel gibt es eine Bar - sah sehr einladend aus, aber wir waren zu müde, ein Restaurant, einen Starbuck wo wir in der Früh gefrühstückt haben und einen Shop wo man auch Getränke kaufen kann. Sollten wir wieder so spät in LA landen werden wir sicher wieder hier übernachten. Das Gateway entspricht den Erwartungen an eine typisches Airport-Hotel von Sheraton. Die Zimmer etwas \"old school\" (inclusive Bad), aber geräumig und von den höheren Stockwerken mit gutem Blick auf das Vorfeld von LAX - schön für Flugzeug-Begeisterte. Der Service nachts war sehr gestresst und wenig freundlich, versprochener Steckdosen-Adapter wurde nie gebracht. Tagsüber dagegen deutlich positiver. Schlafqualität okay, man hört die Flugzeuge trotz dicker Fenster. Kostenloses Shuttle zum Airport, viel Crews übernachten hier. Même si ce quatre étoiles n'a pas de charme particulier, le confort y est très correct et sa situation proche de l'aéroport très pratique après un long voyage fatigant. Au niveau des arrivées à l'aéroport, guettez la navette orange au shuttle stop, bien indiqué, qui vous amènera gratuitement á l'hôtel. Les chambres sont très bien insonorisées, de confort standard. Par contre la piscine est sans charme et peu accueillante, la salle de sport si il vous reste un peu d'énergie est au top. Evitez le petit déjeuner, de qualité médiocre, pour un prix assez élevé. Ceci dit le rapport qualité-prix de cet hôtel est intéressant pour une arrivée tardive ou un départ matinal. Prix 85 euros pour 4 personnes avec deux lits king size, sans petit déjeuner. Das Hotel st ideal für auf der durchreise befindliche Reisende. \n",
      "Airport nah und wie in den USA üblich natürlich ein kostenfreier Shuttle Service der die Terminals von LAX mit dem Hotel verbindet. \n",
      "Trotz der abendlichen Ankunft ging der Check In schnell und effitzient. \n",
      "Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. \n",
      "Die Zimmer waren groß und Geräumig und boten alles was das Herz begehrt. Kostenfreies Internet war leider nur in der Lobby verfügbar. Die Fenster sind gut schallisoliert, so kann man trotz der hektischen umgebung von LAX und dem Flugverkehr ausgezeichnet schlafen.\n",
      "Das Frühstücksbuffet war groß und reichhaltig. Das Preisleistungsverhältniss stimmt hier ebenfalls. 部屋はエグゼクティブスイートですが\n",
      "ただ広いだけで格調は感じられませんでした。\n",
      "ソファも色違いで統一性がなく残念でした。\n",
      "ラウンジの食べ物はかなり良かったと思います。\n",
      "特に酢豚は肉はかりかりに揚がっていて\n",
      "パイナップルも酸っぱくセロリーも美味しかったです。 O hotel é excelente.\n",
      "Quartos limpos, seguros e agradaveis.\n",
      "Possui um restaurtante muito bom no interior e um bar propicio para um bate-papo.\n",
      "A localização nao é muito boa para quem vai a turismo, pois fica longe de alguns pontos turisticos.\n",
      "É bom para negocios, pois fica ao lado do aeroporto. Das Sheraton Gateway Hotel ist perfekt für einen Aufenthalt am Flughafen. Haben dort direkt nach unserer Ankunft in LAX eingecheckt und sind von dort an auf unsere Reise durch den Westen aufgebrochen. \n",
      "Das Hotel selbst ist sehr schön, neu und luxuriös. Tolle, saubere und großzügige Zimmer, Fitnesscenter und Pool im Keller. Nette Beratung und Information an der Rezeption/ Concierge. Klar, die Umgebung ist nicht der Hit, ist halt am Flughafen, aber darum geht es ja dann auch nicht. Parkmöglichkeiten sind direkt am Hotel vorhanden, oder auf dem nahegelegenen öffentlichen Parkplatz, der deutlich günstiger ist. Das Sheraton Gateway Hotel liegt direkt am Flughafen Los Angeles (LAX / KLAX) und kann problemlos mit dem kostenfreien Shuttlebus erreicht werden. Für Reisende welche mit dem Auto anreisen steht ein Valet Parking für $ 28 zur Verfügung oder hinter dem Hotel sind Parkplätze für $ 13 zu haben. \n",
      "Die Zimmer sind gross und praktisch eingerichtet. Das Hotel ist nicht mehr top modern, jedoch keines Falls herabgekommen. \n",
      "Vom Flugverkehr hört man nichts und kann somit vor oder nach einem Flug gut entspannen. \n",
      "Wichtig: Kostenfreies WLAN seht nur in der Hotel Lobby zur Verfügung. Le principal avantage de cet hôtel est qu'il est dans la zone de l'aéroport. En 5mn de navette gratuite vous y êtes, très pratique! Le lobby est moderne et agréable, mais ce n'est pas le cas des chambres, qui mériteraient un rafraîchissement pour tenir les standards Sheraton. Comme dans tout hôtel qui se veut \"haut de gamme\", tous les extras sont payants, la bouteille d'eau dans la chambre, l'accès Internet, le petit déjeuner, etc... Heureusement il y a un petit Starbucks dans le lobby, en plus il ouvre à 5h30, parfait pour ceux qui, arrivés d'Europe la veille, se tortillent dans leur lit à partir de 2 ou 3h du matin... どうもです。\n",
      "ホテルのタイプには、空港を利用するために便利なホテルがあります。\n",
      "大まかにエアポートが名に付いたホテルの事です。\n",
      "特徴としては、空港⇔ホテル間のシャトルサービスかな・・・\n",
      "ま～　トランジットや深夜着でホテル代を安くしたい時に便利。\n",
      "だから、エアポートホテルでcityホテル並みの満足感を求めても。。。\n",
      "言い換えると、普通に寝れて、空港に近くパーキング代・宿泊代が安ければイイホテルだと・・\n",
      "ＬＡＸのシャトルサービスはむらがあるので、ここは早かったとか、ここは全然来ないとかは\n",
      "時、時によります。\n",
      "location的には、シェラトン ゲートウェイＬＡはターミナル８から歩いて行けるくらい近い。\n",
      "ま～　よく知らないとダメかな・・・\n",
      "rate的には、タイミングで＄100切ればいいのでは・・・\n",
      "spgPLTステータス持っていれば、ラウンジはあるし、fitnessは新しいし、poolもありいいのでは・・・（suite upもある）\n",
      "アメリカ系ホテルに多いスターバックスが1Fに・・・・\n",
      "後、meetingが頻回にあるので、結構混む事が多い。 El hotel esta muy limpio y las habitaciones son muy agradables. El servicio fue excelente. lo malo es que me tuve que estacionar en un estacionamiento que esta como a 700 mts y cobran 13 dls, porque en el hotel solo hay valet parking que cuesta 30 dls. 夜10時にLAXに到着、シャトルバスを45分は待ったでしょうか。他のホテルのバスは結構何度も見かけるのにシェラトンのバスは1回のみ。タクシーに乗ってやろうかとも思いましたが、こちらもすごい行列です。\n",
      "そしてホテルに到着するとチェックインでまた20人の行列。しかもフロントのニコリともしない、のらりくらりの態度にはガッカリさせられました。まあシェラトンではいつものことですが・・・。\n",
      "部屋も普通ですが、とても古さを感じます。コンセントなどはボロボロで怖いです。\n",
      "しかも今どきWIFIが12ドルって、どうなの？？ Bonne expérience au Sheraton Gateway LAX , Excellent accueil et service \n",
      "La chambre propre, lit confortable et bien équipée, avec machine à café Starbuck et bouteille d'eau offerte pour les membres Starwood.\n",
      "Parking payant juste à côté et moins cher que celui de l'hôtel. Business center avec internet gratuit\n",
      "Dommage que les restaurants sont tous fermés le dimanche soir seul le bar est ouvert. Es un buen hotel para pasar una noche en el aeropuerto LAX. Es un hotel grande con restaurantes, servicio de autobús al aeropuerto.\n",
      "La habitacion es amplia, cama enorme y comoda, y un baño genial.\n",
      "El room service es buy bueno, el salmon esta espectacular.\n",
      "Tiene wifi sin coste.\n",
      "El unico pero es que no es 100% insonorizado.\n",
      "Es muy recomendable. abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per il viaggio di nozze giugno 2010, lo abbiamo trovato veramente comodo, vicinissimo all'aereoporto, dopo aver atterrato a LAX e ritirato l'auto prenotata lo abbiamo trovato in 5 minuti...\n",
      "Ci è stata assegnata una camera con king bed... veramente il più comodo che abbia mai provato, camere e servizi spaziosi pulitissimi... \n",
      "dopo aver effettuato il nostro tour per l'america dovevamo ripartire da Lax ed ovviamente abbiamo riscelto questo hotel e sicuramente se mai torneremo sarà la nostra meta.... Très bien pour terminer en beauté le voyage, près de l'aéroport, donc pratico-pratique... Avec une vue imprenable sur la piste! \n",
      "Le restaurant adjacent au lobby \"The Brasserie\" offre une bonne cuisine, plutôt calme le midi donc un service rapide. Le serveur nous a accordé toute son attention, très jovial avec les touristes; intéressant pour apprendre le style de vie californien, les enjeux politiques, etc....\n",
      "En dehors de l'heure du repas, on peut profiter d'une piscine, d'un Spa extérieur sur une terrasse joliment aménagée. Juste en face, de l'intérieur, on peut s'entraîner à la salle d'exercice. Une boutique très invitante vous attend aussi dans le lobby pour finaliser l'achat de souvenirs... Avant de reprendre la navette vers votre vol! Das Hotel liegt sehr nahe zum Flughafen LAX. Mit dem Shuttlebus ist man innert kürzester Zeit im Hotel. Das ist besonders praktisch, wenn man wie wir eher später am Abend ankommt, und eigentlich nur noch froh ist, in ein schönes grosses Bett fallen zu können. Was man hier in diesem Hotel ausgezeichnet kann.\n",
      "Der Empfang war freundlich und unkompliziert. Das Zimmer sauber und geräumig. Für die erste Nacht nach der Ankunft also absolut zu empfehlen.\n",
      "Wir haben keinerlei Serviceleistungen beansprucht, deshalb können wir diesen Punkt nicht bewerten.\n",
      "Wir haben LA bereits im letzten Sommer besucht. Da haben wir unsere erste Nacht im Courtyard Los Angeles LAX/Century Boulevard verbracht, was uns vom Comfort her, im Vergleich zu diesem Hotel etwas besser gefallen hat. Aber das Sheraton hat dafür das bessere Preis/Leistungs Verhältnis. トランジットのためだけに宿泊したのですが、シャトルバスもあり、空港からも近く便利でした。お部屋も快適で、過ごしやすかったです。 Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel una sola notte in attesa del nostro volo di rientro. L'hotel è vicinissimo all'aereoporto ed offre un servizio di navetta gratuito da e per aereoporto. L'hotel è molto elegante, ha una hall immensa e arredata con gusto, il personale è cordiale, disponibile e gentile.La camera è spaziosa ed elegante ed il letto è molto confortevole. il bagno con vasca non è grandissimo, ma funzionale. Ottima pulizia.\n",
      "Alla reception organizzano anche tour di Los Angeles con pick up direttamente in albergo. Hotel da consigliare, veramente bello. ロサンゼルスからのフライトに備えて前泊しました。\n",
      "空港でシャトルバスがなかなか来なく３０分程待たされましたが空港からは一番近いホテルではないでしょうか。\n",
      "部屋は１人で泊まるには広過ぎ。その反対にバスルームが非常に狭かったです。\n",
      "乗り継ぎのフライトで１泊だけするには悪くはないホテルだと思います。 O hotel é bem luxuoso, as camas são divinas, tivemos excelentes noites de sono. Nenhum barulho, apesar de estar super perto do aeroporto. Café da manhã muito bom, estilo buffet, já incluído na diária. Como ficamos lá no final de semana, conseguimos uma tarifa excelente (acredito que por ser um hotel de negocios, deva ser mais caro durante a semana). Localização bem conveniente para quem quer ir a St Monica (15 km), e para Hollywood. Adoramos. コンジェルジュデスクのマネジャー　買い物のことについてたずねても、私は買い物には行かないから、　わからない。　預けた荷物がない。私がクロークの中を探すはめに。。２度と泊まりません。 la habitacion vieja, no incluye parqueo y el internet tambien se cobra. Queda en una zona cerca del aeropuerto pero no hay muchos restaurantes para cenar en los alrededores. Sehr netter freundlicher Empfang. Upgrade auf eine corner Suite erhalten. Zimmer sehr geräumig und sauber. Badezimmer auch groß, wurde aber meiner Meinung nach bei der Renovierung nicht mit erneuert. Trotz Nähe zum Flughafen waren die Fluggeräusche erträglich. Hier verstehe ich grundsätzlich nicht, warum die Amis bezüglich Lärmschutzfenster nicht unseren Standart erreichen. Pool und Liegen ok. Check-out um 18:00 völlig problemlos. Executive Lounge nichts besonderes, Speiseauswahl am Abend war ganz ok. Alkoholische Getränke natürlich nur gegen Bezahlung. Check-out am Abend war auch sehr zuvorkommend. Shuttle zum Flughafen alle 15 Minuten. Das Sheraton liegt wirklich gut zum Flughafen LA. Man ist in kurzer Zeit mit dem kostenlosen Hotelshuttel im Hotel bzw zurück am Flughafen. Die Zimmer sind groß und sauber. Trotz der Nähe zum Flughafen hört man so gut wie nichts. Die Schallschutzfenster haben einen sehr guten Wert.\n",
      "Wir waren skeptisch, aber es war wirklich nur ein Summen zu hören. Es hat nicht gestört.\n",
      "Das Frühstücksbüfett-gegen Aufpreis- hatte ein großes Angebot und war sehr gut.\n",
      "Wir waren sehr zufrieden und können das Hotel für die erste Nacht in LA empfehlen. Muy buen hotel para quien quiera estar muy cerca del aeropuerto! Nos alojamos las dos ultimas noches de nuestras vacaciones en California, asi pudimos devolver el auto una noche antes, y poder llegar tranquilos al aeropuerto con el shuttle de cortesia que pasa por la puerta del hotel. Muy comodas y amplias las habitaciones. Desayuno muy completo aunque no tan accesible el precio. La decoracion es moderna, muy linda la zona de la piscina. Tiene Bar y restaurants. Necesitabamos pesar las maletas y nos facilitaron una balanza en la habitacion. Muy buena atencion del personal. Von zu Hause früh gebucht - daher sehr gute Rate bekommen. Vor Ort haben wir ein Upgrade gebucht. Für 30$/Nacht bekamen wir ein Zimmer auf der obersten Etage mit Blick auf das Rollfeld des LA International Airport, freies W-Lan und Zugang zur Lounge, in der es ein Continentales Früstück und einfaches Abendessen gab. Kostenlos gab es nur in der Hotellobby W-Lan. Günstige Parkplätze hinter dem Hotel auf einem privaten Parkplatz (13,20$/Nacht). Ich war bereits in 2 anderen Airporthotel am Lax. Vom Preis/Leistungsverhältnis war es dort am besten. Also das Hotel ist wirklich nur einen Steinwurf vom Airport entfernt. Das Hotel wirkt in der Lobby sehr ansprechend und modern. Lerder fand ich meine Suite irgendwie abgewohnt und nicht gerade besonders. Die executiv Lounge war typisch amerikanisch. Da sollte man nicht viel erwarten. Sehr angenehm empfand ich die freundlichkeit und hilfsbereitschaft. Für nen guten Preis kann man das Hotel wirklich empfehlen. besser als das Hilton LAX. Frühstück hatte ich in der Lounge das war typisch amerikanisch, sehr sparsam aber hatte wenigstens etwas niveau.\n",
      "Bin im groben mit dem Hotel zu frieden. Es lohnst sich kaum ins den Shuttle Bus vom Airport zum Hotel einzusteiegen, 5 Minuten später ist man bereist am Ziel.\n",
      "Der Sevice war sehr gut freundlich und ich hatte in Nullkommanix mein zimmer.\n",
      "Man half mir später auch bei meinem defektem Kofferschloss, alles sehr schnell und bestens. Unten im Foyer ist ein Starbucks, wo man sich morgens ab 5:30 mit Frühstück versorgen kann. Es fährt ein Trolley Shuttle für5 US $ bis Manhattan Beach und zu einer kleinen Mall, wenn man mag.\n",
      "Das Hotel ist trotz Airport Nähe sehr ruhig. Die Zimmer könten nach meinem Geschmack etwas besser gesaugt werden. Morgens kommt die Rechnung unterd er Tür durch und den Zimmerschlüssel wirft man in eine Box, schneller gehts nicht. Das Sheraton Gateway LA dient einzig und allein dem Zweck, es für eine Nacht als Stopover in LA nach einem Transatlantikflug zu nutzen. Man ist mit dem Shuttle (auf den man leider recht lange wartet) in 5 Minuten vom Terminal des LAX dort. Riesen-Lobby, diverse Airline-Crews checken ein. Zimmer ziemlich abgewohnt, 70ies/80ies Style. Betten sind gut. Sauberkeit halbwegs ok. Natürlich Fluglärm des Airports. Aber für eine Nacht ok. Nettes Goodie: Starbucks-Filiale in der Lobby. 旅の始まりと終わりをこの空港近くのホテルで１泊＋デイユースしました。\n",
      "空港からのシャトルバスに乗ればすぐ着くので便利です。\n",
      "空調の音が少しうるさかったですが、部屋にはスタバのインスタントコーヒーもあり、\n",
      "居心地良かったです。\n",
      "あまり長時間滞在するわけではなかったので期待してませんでしたが、\n",
      "意外とホテルがきれいで広くて、\n",
      "プールもしっかり利用させて頂きました。\n",
      "帰りの飛行機までデイユースで利用させてもらったのですが、\n",
      "中途半端なチェックアウト時間がスケジュール的にきつかったので\n",
      "ちょっと交渉したところ数時間サービスで延長して頂き有難かったです。\n",
      "歩いて少しいくとレンタカーオフィスにもいけました。 Dieses Hotel zeichnet sich durch freundliche Mitarbeiter (bis auf eine Frau im Shop), große Zimmer mit spektakulärem Blick auf Los Angeles und eine moderne Ausstattung aus. Es war mir eine Freude eine Woche in diesem Hotel zu verbringen. Mit dem Auto oder Taxi lässt sich von ihm ausgehend perfekt LA erkunden und anschließend lässt man sich vom kostenfreien Airportshuttle zum LAX Airport fahren. Der Fitnessbereich ist hell, freundlich und modern mit Blick auf den Pool. Die Lobby bietet kostenloses Internet. Also alles bestens. \n",
      "Das Frühstück hat mir sehr geschmeckt und war vernünftig im Preis. Wir hatten Glück und haben über Priceline das Sheraton Gateway bekommen, zu einem wirklich sensationellen Preis. Zwar kommt noch die Gebühr fürs Parken hinzu, aber die zahlen Sie ja eigentlich überall in LA.\n",
      "Schöne Standardzimmer, mit Kaffeemaschine und wirklich sehr überraschend, vom Fluglärm war nichts zu hören.\n",
      "Wenn Sie nur 1-2 Tage übernachten (Ankunft oder Abflug) sind Sie durch die gute Verkehrsanbindung überall relativ schnell.\n",
      "Empfehlenswert! Das Hotel ist ideal gelegen für späte Ankünfte oder frühe Abflüge vom internationalen Flughafen Los Angeles LAX. Ein Shuttlebus verkehrt regelmässig zwischen den Terminals und dem Hotel.\n",
      "Die Zimmer sind sehr gut schallisoliert und entsprechen typischem Sheraton-Standard. Das Bad ist etwas älteren Datums und eher klein, aber sauber und zweckmässig.\n",
      "Für das schnelle Frühstück bietet sich die Starbucks-Filiale direkt im Hotel an - ansonsten ist auch das Frühstücksbuffent empfehlenswert.\n",
      "Starwood Platinum Mitglieder erhalten übrigens Restaurantgutscheine am Wochenende, wenn die Lounge geschlossen ist. Upgrades sind ebenfalls keine Seltenheit hier für Statusgäste.\n",
      "Wer mit dem Mietwagen kommt: Self Parking gibts für US$12 auf der Rückseite des Hotels, auf dem grossen Parkplatz auf der anderen Strassenseite; Valetparking ist auch möglich direkt beim Hotel.\n",
      "Wer nur kurz da ist oder früh morgens weiterreist: Gratisparken geht auf der Strasse hinter dem Hotel, für 2h tagsüber, bzw. bis zum Morgen. Schilder beachten! Questo hotel è consigliato come appoggio per l'aeroporto. La struttura è splendida, le camere spaziose ed arredate elegantemente. Il rapporto qualità/prezzo è buono!\n",
      "L'hotel mette a disposizione una navetta disponibile 24h su 24 da e per l'aeroporto. Sconsigliato invece per chi desidera visitare i maggiori luoghi di interesse di Los Angeles. カリフォルニア旅行の帰りの定宿です。LAXに近いので余裕をもってすごせます。お部屋自体ゴージャスさはありませんが広いのでとても快適です。ただ不便なのは駐車場が少し離れたところにあることです。裏道にありますので夜はちょっと恐いです。利用したことはありませんが、LAXへのシャトルバスも出ているようです。 机场和酒店之间有免费班车，几分钟就到了，非常近。转机非常方便。酒店的床非常舒服，坐了十几个小时飞机好难受，这个舒适的大床终于让我好好休息了一晚。自助早餐很丰盛，西餐的风格。 Das Hotel ist sehr nahe am Flughafen gelegen und weit weg von allem anderen. Essensmöglichkeiten gibt es ausser im Hotel in nächster Umgebung keine. Was aber bei Flughafenhotels ja auch normal ist…\n",
      "Das Zimmer ist sauber, die Grösse ist absolut okay und alles Wichtige ist vorhanden. Wir sind relativ spät abends angekommen, der Service beim Valet und Check-in war aber trotzdem einwandfrei. Der Preis war dank eines Samstag abends mehr als fair, bei Gelegenheit also gerne wieder mal… zum wiederholten Male habe ich das Hotel gewählt. Da es für eine oder zwei Nächte wirklich nett ist. Toller service, gute Lage und das Preisleistungsverhältnis stimmte. jedoch habe ich die Zimmer von Deutschland aus gebucht.\n",
      "Wenn einer Länger in LA steht und Mobil ist würde ich auch immer in dieser Gegend absteigen , da die Preise dort deutlich günstiger sind und man überall schnell hin kommt.\n",
      "Parken am Besten hinter dem Hotel....dort ist self parking von 9,99-13,99 Dollar und sind vielleicht 3 Gehminuten Das Hotel liegt direkt am Flughafen und hat einen kostenlosen Shuttleservice. Dsa Auto sollte aus Kostengründen bei einem anliegenden Parkcenter abgestellt werden ,da das Hotel selbst nur teures Valletparking anbietet.\n",
      "Die Zimmer sind sehr großzügig , sauber und modern eingerichtet.\n",
      "Ein leichter Nachteil ist es dass man nach Holywood und Downtown mit dem Mietwagen längere Zeit unterwegs ist.\n",
      "Die Poolanlage ist mit Geschmack gestaltet und bietet eine Vielzahl verschiedener Liegemöglichkeiten sowie eine Poolbar. Ich habe das Hotel nur für eine Nacht genutzt um meinen Flug bequemer erreichen zu können. Ich hatte ein Zimmer auf dem Club Floor, selbstverständlich mit Lounge Zugang. Das Zimmer war ausreichend groß und sauber. Die Lounge war nichts besonderes, aber für einen schnellen Drink bzw ein schnelles Frühstück war sie mehr als ausreichend. Der dropoff Service zum Flughafen klappt amerikatypisch perfekt. Sicherlich kein Hotel für einen ausgedehnten Los Angeles Urlaub, aber dafür ist ein Airport Hotel schließlich auch nicht da. Insgesamt ein gutes Hotel mit allen Annehmlichkeiten, die man in einem Airport Hotel benötigt. Sollte ich einmal wieder eine Nacht in LAX verbringen müsen, werde ich sicherlich zurückkommen. Lo Sheraton Gateway di LAX è un hotel bello, pulito, moderno e confortevole. Seppur decisamente vicino all'aeroporto l'albergo è molto silenzioso e rappresenta un buon punto dio partenza per visitare LA: Venice Beach è a un passo così come la Pacific Coast Hwy che vi permetterà di salire la costa e visitare Santa Monica, Malibù ecc. \n",
      "Il centro città rimane più distante ma comunque facilmente raggiungibile in auto. \n",
      "Purtroppo il parcheggio non è incluso quindi sarà necessario utilizzare il servizio di valet parking oppure l'autosilo (sempre a pagamento) nel building adiacente. Fiquei hospedado nesse hotel, de 22 até 25 de julho de 2010. Na minha saída, dia 25/07/2010, esqueci meu casaco de couro no quarto em que fiquei. Telefonei nesse mesmo dia, pediram-me 1 dia para dar uma resposta, foi um pouco trabalhoso esses 4 contatos feitos por telefone, mas o casaco tinha sido entregue pela camareira no Departamento de achados e perdidos. A senhora Maxi, responsável pelo referido Setor, fez a entrega do casaco para mim, com gentileza e profissionalismo. Modern eingerichtet, sauber, hell, sehr nah am Flughafen und schnell auf dem Freeway - und am besten: Sehr gut isolierte Fenster, so dass man den Nachteil des sehr nahen Flughafens kaum bemerkte. Relativ teurer Parkplatz vor dem Hotel, da ist es besser, ein paar Minuten zur Rückseite zu laufen und das Auto auf dem Flughafenparkplatz abzustellen. Ohne Auto geht's dort übrigens kaum. \n",
      "Würde bei der nächsten Reise wieder dort unterkommen. Service:\n",
      "Ein ausgesprochen freundliches Personal, das Bustouren organisiert und bei sämtlichen Anfragen das Beste gibt.\n",
      "Wir kamen ohne Reservierung und konnten mit Freundlichkeit den Internetpreis heraushandeln und sparten so über 100 Dollar pro Nacht!\n",
      "Zimmer:\n",
      "Einem 4 Sterne Hotel auf jedenfall angemessen und wirklich traumhafte Betten - so gut habe ich selbst in meinem Wasserbett zu Hause nicht geschlafen.\n",
      "Klimaanlage funktioniert einwandfrei. Super TV Programm und Minibar.\n",
      "Lage/Parkmöglichkeiten:\n",
      "Ein bewachter Parkplatz mit Sonderkondotionen für Hotelgäste in unmittelbarer Nähe vorhanden. Vor unserer Abreise nach Deutschland haben wir eine Nacht in diesem Hotel geschlafen und sind leider nicht sehr zufrieden. Das erhaltene Zimmer in eine der unteren Etagen war nicht besonders sauber, die Badewanne zeigte deutliche Spuren der Vorgänger (Duschgelränder), Haare waren auch zu finden. Das Personal wirkte ein wenig überfordert, obwohl uns das Hotel recht leer vorkam und war alles andere als freundlich zu uns. Parken kostete auf dem öffentlichen Parkplatz 15$. Das positivste an diesem Hotel ist die unmittelbare Nähe zum Flughafen. Das Hotel liegt praktisch am Flughafen. Zimmer sind durchschnitt, alles vorhanden was man braucht, mehr nicht. Das Bad in unserem Zimmer war zwar sauber, aber ziemlich renovierungsbedürftig. Presonal beim Check-in hat seinen Job gemacht mehr aber auch nicht. Kein Hinweis darauf wo man parken kann, das muss man schon selbst erfragen. Ansonsten gehen die wohl davon aus, daß man das teure Valet-Parking in Anspruch nimmt. \n",
      "Fenster sind gut abgedichtet, die Flughafengeräusche bleiben also weitestgehend draussen. Habe schon deutlich lautere Hotels bewohnt, die nicht am Flughafen lagen. Starbucks ist im Hotel. Das Restaurant ist ein Italiener. Wir sind in die Champions Sportsbar im benachbarten Marriott Hotel gegangen. Ist vom Preis her einfach akzeptabler als der auf edel getrimmte Italiener im Hotel selbst, bei dem wohl hauptsächlich die Preise edel sind. Das Sheraton Gateway bietet sich bei einem Zwischenstopp in Los Angeles wie auch für einen längeren Aufenthalt an. Das Hotel liegt 1 Kilometer vom L.A.-Airport entfernt, hat dadurch eine perfekte Anknüpfung an die wichtigsten Verkehrswege in Los Angeles. Das Hotel wurde vor drei Jahren generalüberholt und offeriert Luxus zu einem vernünftigen Preis. Dieses Hotel \" Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles \" eignet sich Optimal wenn Sie in LAX am Flughafen ankommen. Ersmal mit den Bus ins Hotel 1 Nacht schlafen , minimaler Fluglärm, dann am Nächsten Tag zum Auto Verleih ( auch zu Fuss 5 Minuten zu erreichen ) da alle in der Nähe sind. \n",
      "Jetzt kann man sich auf Californien FREUEN. Ich war nur eine Nacht im Juli 2009 zu Gast in dem Hotel. Wir benötigten ein Hotel in der nähe vom Flughafen, und da passte das Hotel perfekt. Da wir über hotwire buchten, war es sogar sehr günstig. Airport Shuttle klappte sogar noch kurz vor Mitternacht perfekt. Checkin um 1h Nachts war kein Problem. Sehr sauber, und netter Service. gutes hotel nach langem flug von europa. das frühstücksbüfett (mehrpreis), war reichlich und sehr gut. auf grund der lage, ist das hotel jedoch für einen mehrtägigen aufenthalt in los angeles weniger geeignet. der swimmingpool war sehr schön und war in der größe ausreichend. das starbuck cafe machte einen schlechteren eindruck als der gesamte hoteleindruck. Eigentlich als Stop-over-Hotel für eine Nacht genutzt, waren wir vom Sheraton Gateway restlos begeistert, ein Hotel mit Vorbildfunktion: Ideale Lage in kurzer Entfernung zum Flughafen (mit Shuttlebus alle 15 Min.), sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal (besonders der Concierge), modern und stilvoll eingerichtete Zimmer mit super Schlafkomfort und nicht zuletzt die Qualität der Hors d'oeuvres and Cocktails in the Club Lounge sind outstanding. Wem amerikanischer Durchschnittskaffee nicht so behagt, findet in der Lobby des Hotels einen \"integrierten\" STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP, täglich ab 7 Uhr geöffnet. Ein perfekt ausgestattetes, aber unaufdringliches \"Business Center\" findet sich ebenso im weitläufigen Lobby-Bereich. \n",
      "Alles in allem ist das Sheraton Gateway die beste Wahl für einen Kurzaufenthalt in L.A. für all jene, die über etwas dezentem, nächtlichem Fluglärm hinwegsehen können. Bon hôtel dont l'avantage principal est sa proximité des terminaux de l'aéroport de LOS ANGELES. A noter qu'il existe beaucoup d'autres hôtels sur Century boulevard. Arrivés au terminal 2, nous avons fait le trajet à pied en quelques minutes. L'hôtel est par ailleurs très bien desservi par une navette fréquente. La décoration est contemporaine mais elle est plaquée sur un immeuble manifestement ancien, ce qui donne un étrange décalage. Les pistes de l'aéroport étant de chaque côté de l'hôtel, on ne peut échapper au bruit des avions. Petit déjeuner buffet avec un très grand choix. Très bon rapport qualité-prix. Sehr ansprechendes Hotel der gehobenen Klasse, direkt am Airport mit Zubringershuttle. Die sauberen, großzügig gestalteten Zimmer bieten guten Übernachtungskomfort. Für Familien besteht die Möglichkeit zwei Doppelzimmer \n",
      "mit Verbindungstüre zu buchen. Die Unterkunft hat schöne Aussicht auf das Flughafengelände. Für die nötige Ruhe ist durch Schallschutzfenster gesorgt.\n",
      "Das Hotel bietet sich als Ausgangs- oder Endpunkt für eine Kalifornienrundreise an.\n",
      "Ein Pool zur Entspannung ist vorhanden. Grosses Hotel mit gratis Shuttle Bus direkt von den Terminals LAX. Ich war zweimal innerhalb einer WOche in diesem Hotel. Fazit: Erstes mal top und ruhig, da einerseits am Sonntagabend und mit Zimmer zur Rückseite des Hotels (keine Start und Landebahn), beim zweiten mal auf der Vorderseite: Enorm Laut und die ganze Nacht Flugbetrieb mit Starts und Landungen. Also: Beim Check-in nach Zimmer auf Rückseite fragen... Businesshotel mit hohem Standard, nach einigen Motelaufenthalten war dieses Hotel eine willkommene hochwertige Abwechslung. Moderne Inneneinrichtung, sauber, freundlich und absolut zeitgemäß, großzügige Zimmer, sehr schöne Poolanlage mit schöner Möblierung, sehr guter Fitnessraum, gutes Frühstück, gutes Restaurant, gute Anbindung (Shuttle) an die Gates des Flughafens, aber man ist auch schnell in Santa Monica Beach oder Venice Beach.\n",
      "Wir würden dort jederzeit gern wieder übernachten. ビジネスホテルと書いたが日本のそれとは大きく雰囲気が異なって\n",
      "すべてがゴージャスでゆったりしている。\n",
      "空港の近くなのでビジネス客が多い。\n",
      "アーバンな雰囲気の漂う高級なホテルと言った感じで\n",
      "もちろん部屋も広くスタッフの感じもフレンドリーなのに丁寧でとても良かった。\n",
      "レストランのお食事もとても美味しく、割合リーズナブル。\n",
      "なんとここで子供が鼻血を出してしまうと言うハプニングに見舞われてしまったが、\n",
      "女性スタッフの人の優しく親身な応対には感激した。\n",
      "エントランスのすぐ横にスターバックスもある。\n",
      "寒いので誰もいなかったけど、プールもかなり雰囲気がよかった。\n",
      "空港からは無料のシャトルバスが出ているので（オレンジ色のサインのライトブルーの車体）\n",
      "移動にも困ることはなかった。 1 Woche USA Westcoast roadtrip – als kleines Geburtstagsgeschenk für die Eltern.\n",
      "Lage: In sehr kurzer Entfernung zum Flughafen LAX (Shuttlebus alle 15 Min.), aus unseren Zimmern konnten wir sogar die Jets im letzten Stück des Landeanflugs sehen (war nicht störend). Parkplatz in der Nähe mit Sonderkondotionen für Hotelgäste. Die Angebote zum Einkaufen und Essen in Fußweite außerhalb des Hotels sind jedoch beschränkt, somit blieben wir im Sheraton.\n",
      "Hotel: Sehr schöne und stylishe Lobby, der check-in tadellos! Freundlich, zuvorkommend, einfach perfekt! Der Poolbereich war ansprechend aber etwas klein. In der Lobby des Hotels gibt es einen Starbucks.\n",
      "Zimmer: Corner-Suite mit Sofaecke bekommen, riesig, sauber, stylish, modern und stilvoll; fantatisches Bett. Das Bad war dagegen etwas klein. Klimaanlage funktioniert einwandfrei. Minibar. Starbucks-Kaffee zum brühen. Der Zimmerservice war schnell und das Essen sehr gut und reichhaltig für diesen angenehmen Preis!\n",
      "Frühstücksbuffet: Umfangreich, lecker. Der Service war sehr gut!\n",
      "Fazit: Als Stop-over-Hotel für eine Nacht am LAX ideal; wir waren vom Sheraton Gateway restlos begeistert! Wir haben das Sheraton Gateway als erstes Hotel unserer Rundreise gehabt. Es lag nah am Flughafen, was durchaus seine Vorteile hat, nachdem man so lange im Flugzeug gesessen hat und sich in der Nähe seinen Mietwagen abholt. Allerdings ist auch hier das Valet Parking recht teuer, besser den Self-Parking Parkplatz hinter dem Hotel für 12 oder 13 $ nutzen, ansonsten werden 25 $ fällig.\n",
      "Personal sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sind geräumig und trotz des Flughafens ruhig. OK, das Badezimmer könnte etwas neuer sein, aber trotzdem war alles sauber und zufriedenstellend. In der Nähe gibt es viele Supermärkte und Schnellrestaurants, perfekt für einen Städtetrip, wo man nicht unnötig viel Zeit in Restaurants verbringen möchte. Ich empfehle meinen Lieblings-Supermarkt Ralphs, den es überwiegend in Südkalifornien gibt. Holen Sie sich die kostenlose Rabattkarte, und Sie sparen sofort wahnsinnig viel ;-) Das Sheraton ist im Grunde genommen in Laufdistanz zu den Terminals von LAX, jedoch empfiehlt es sich mit Gepäck den hoteleigenen, kostenlosen Shuttlebus zu nehmen.\n",
      "Das Hotel ist ideal für die erste oder letzte Nacht im Großraum LA, wenn man nach oder vor dem Flug nicht mehr lange fahren möchte. Will man jedoch, die Sehenswürdigkeiten von LA besichtigen würde ich ein anderes Hotel wählen, da man rund um den Flughafen und damit auch rund um das Hotel eigentlich ständig im Verkehsstau steckt und damit kostbare Zeit verliert.\n",
      "Das Hotel an sich ist ein typisches Sheraton Hotel für Geschäftsleute. Die Hotelzimmer sind daher top ausgestattet und sauber. Der Flughafenlärm ist durch Schallschutzfenster ausreichend abgeschirmt.\n",
      "Ein großes kostenloses Business-Center, ein etwas schattiger Pool und eine schöne Lobby-Bar stehen zur Verfügung. In der Lobby befindet sich auch noch eine Starbucks-Filiale, bei der aber vor allem am Morgen lange Wartezeiten üblich sind. Das Personal ist trotz der Umtriebigkeit sehr freundlich und man erhält eigentlich immer auf Wunsch ein Zimmer mit Flughafenblick (sehr interessant, die Jumbos beim Landen zu beobachten) oder ohne Flughafenblick (hier hört man wirklich garnichts vom Flugzeug-Lärm). Das 4 Sterne Hotel liegt nahezu fussläufig zum Internationalen Flughafen Los Angeles und bietet daher eine gute Anlaufstation für die erste Nacht nach Ankunft mit dem Flugzeug in Los Angeles! Zusätzlich bietet das Hotel vom Flughafen einen kostenlosen Shuttle Service an. \n",
      "Die Hotelzimmer entsprechen weitgehend den gewohnten Standard eines Sharaton Hotels.\n",
      "Angenehm auch der kostenlose Zugang ins Internet von verschiedenen PC in der Hotel Lobby. Wir haben das Sheraton am Flughafen gewählt um uns vor unserem weiterflug nach Hawaii auszuruhen und sind positiv überrascht worden. Da wir das Hotel über Hotwire gebucht hatten war das Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut. Vom Airport wird man mit einem Shuttlebus abgeholt. Das Personal war sehr freundlich. Das Zimmer war sauber, ausreichend groß und die üblichen Sheraton-Annehmlichkeiten vorhanden.\n",
      "Natürlich lohnt sich das Hotel nicht für mehrere Tage oder um L.A. zu erkunden. Vor dem Weiterflug durch die USA waren wir für 2 Nächte in dem Airporthotel.\n",
      "Die Zimmer hatten eine angenehme Größe, das Bad war ok und alles war sauber.\n",
      "Der kostenlose Shuttle zum Flughafen fährt rund um die Uhr. Infos und kurze Empfehlungen für einen Abstecher nach LA gabs an der Rezeption. \n",
      "Ein kleines und mit dem nötigsten ausgestattete Fitness-Studio sowie ein Pool haben wir auch gefunden.\n",
      "Zum Essen hat man die Auswal zwischen einem Restaurant und einer Bar. Zumindest das Essen in der Bar war sehr gut und lecker und günstig zu bekommen.\n",
      "Wer also ein 08/15 Hotel nahe dem Flughafen sucht ist hier nicht verkehrt. In direkter Nachbarschaft befinden sich weitere Hotels, so dass man auch die dortigen Bars/Restaurants ausprobieren kann. Das Sheraton war das Ende unserer Rundreise und da wir von LA abfliegen sollten, haben wir uns für eine Unterkunft direkt am Flughafen entschieden. Trotz der günstigen Lage ist jedoch von Fluglärm innerhalb des Hotels nichts zu hören, lediglich beim Entspannen am Pool nerven dann doch die andauern startenden und landenden Maschinen.\n",
      "Das Hotel ist nicht mehr das neuste, aber insgesamt trotzdem Sheraton- Standard, lediglich die fehlenden Minibar war zu bemängeln. Auf der Durchreise in den USA bin ich in Los Angeles auf der Suche gewesen nach einem preiswerten Hotel der Starwood Gruppe, das Nahe am Flughafen war. Dabei bin ich auf das Sheraton Gateway gestossen.\n",
      "Das Hotel hat einen eigenen (gesharten) kostenlosen Shuttle, der alle 15-20 Minuten seine Runden fährt von/zum Hotel und Flughafen und den Terminals. Der Shuttlefahrer ist sehr hilfsbereit und innert wenigen Minuten ist das Hotel erreicht.\n",
      "Eine anfangs etwas verwirrene Hotelloge, wo es denn nun hoch geht zu den Zimmern. Doch der Weg war schnell gefunden dank den freundlichen Angestellten.\n",
      "Ich erhielt ein Zimmer im vierten Stock (408), das am Ende des Gangs mit Fenster nach Richtung Parkplatz hatte. Es war sehr ruhig und eignete sich für einen tiefen guten Schlaf, den ich brauchte nach einem langen Flug. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und sauber. Die Einrichtung war gewöhnlicher U.S. Standard und Sheraton Standard.\n",
      "Negativer Punkt, es war keine Minibar vorhanden, lediglich die obligate Starbucks Beutel und Kaffeemaschine. Achtung, die Wasserflasche kostet extra 4.50 USD und ist nicht kostenlos, wie es anmuten mag.\n",
      "Ich habe das Hotel am darauffolgenden Tag bereits wieder verlassen müssen für den Weiterflug in LAX.\n",
      "Der Checkout via \"Express Checkout Box\" geht sowieso reibungslos, da ich keine ZUsatzkosten mehr hatte.\n",
      "Alles in allem war ich sehr zufrieden, habe sogar noch ein Dankeschön Mail erhalten vom GM, da ich SPG MItglied bin (Starwood Preferred Guest).\n",
      "Würde es jedenfalls weiterempfehlen, wer nahe dem Airport ein günstiges Hotel sucht, das sauber und ruhig ist - was ja nicht selbstverständlich ist nahe eines Flughafens. Nach fünf bis zehn Minuten mit dem Shufflebus ist man am Hotel. Ein gro0zügige Lobby mit freundlichem Service erwartet den Gast. Die Zimmer sind ordentlich und sauber, nicht gerade modern. Die Bäder sind amerikanischer Durchschnitt und tadellos. Ein ansprechende Hotelbar hilft gegen Jetlag. Das Frühstück ist durchschnittlich. Gleichwohl ist das Hotel mit seinem Preis- Leistungsverhältnis dank seiner Lage eine gute Empfehlung für die Nacht vor dem Weiterflug Wir haben in diesem Hotel 1 Nacht vor unserem Rückflug nach Deutschland übernachtet. Das Hotel liegt direkt neben dem Flughafen. Ein kostenloser Shuttlebus fährt ca. alle 15 - 20 Minuten. \n",
      "Das Hotel ist sehr modern gestaltet. In der Lobby und in der angrenzenden Lounge wurde das Thema Hollywood bei der Gestaltung aufgegriffen. Auch die Zimmer sind sehr schön und zeitgemäß eingerichtet. \n",
      "Leider ist darin kein Safe enthalten, was mich bei einem längeren Aufenthalt stören würde.\n",
      "In der Lobby ist eine Filiale von Starbucks untergebracht. \n",
      "Auf der Hinreise haben wir im Westin LAX übernachtet. Das Sheraton würde ich beim nächsten Mal bevorzugen. Diese Hotel liegt direkt neben LAX und ist daher ideal für ankommende oder abreisende Personen geeignet. Wir hatten ein Zimmer in einem der obersten Stöcke und hatten volle sicht auf den Runway des Flughafens was bei Nacht einfach unglaublich spektaklär ist!\n",
      "Die Workout area habe ich zudem ausführlich getestet und überdurchschnittlich gut im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels in dieser Preisklasse! Habe das Hotel zu einem guten Preis über Priceline gebucht. Die Anbindung an den Flughafen ist dank Shuttle sehr gut, zur Not könnte man auch Laufen. Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung, man sieht aber schon, dass das Hotel einige Jahr auf dem Buckel hat. Erst am zweiten Tag nach der Ankunft haben wir unseren Mietwagen geholt und konnten alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in LA recht gut erreichen. Wenn man parken will, bietet sich der Parkplatz auf der Rückseite des Hotels an, der aber allerdings von einem Dritten betrieben wird. Das Valet Parking war uns dann doch etwas zu teuer. Trotz SPG Status leider keinen Zugang zur Lounge erhalten, das mag wohl an der Priceline Buchung liegen. Weiterhin hatte ich bereits im Voraus ein Babybett bestellt, was mir auch bestätigt wurde, dann im Hotel aber wieder abgesagt wurde. In meinen Augen ein absoluter Minuspunkt, denn hätte ich hier nicht mein faltbares Babybett mitgebracht, wären wir dumm dagestanden.\n"
